  Hospital smoking ban labelled 'torture'",
	"description": "A mental health patient who killed himself was put off seeking hospital treatment because he was not allowed to smoke onsite, a lawyer leading a judicial review application on smoking in hospitals says.",

	"content": "A mental health patient who killed himself was put off seeking hospital treatment because he was not allowed to smoke onsite, a lawyer leading a judicial review application on smoking in hospitals says.
A smoking ban on hospital grounds including outside psychiatric wards by the Waitemata District Health Board is a breach of human rights, barrister Richard Francois argued at the High Court at Auckland today.
He is calling the proposal "torture" on the hospitals' most vulnerable patients.
"Psychiatric patients are segregated," Francois said in his opening statement.
"They're locked in a room and told they can't smoke cigarettes in a time they're under extreme stress, have been hauled away from family, friends and employment."
He argues that research does not back up the need for psychiatric patients to give up smoking on hospital grounds for their health or the health of others, and is simply a breach of rights which will create a barrier for patients wanting to seek help.
He raised an example of a Hillmorton Hospital patient in Christchurch who used to self-refer himself to the psychiatric ward after attempting suicide.
His mother had said he "quite liked" being there but this changed after a smoking ban came in, Francois said, reading from a Coroner's report.
"He killed himself this time. Smoking was everything to him, it was like the be all and end all of it really."
He extended his application against severely incapacitated patients in the general ward too, who should be allowed a room to smoke in since they can't take themselves outside, he said.
Francois' client was previously also in this category, he said.
"It's discrimination, the sicker you are," Francois said.
Waitemata DHB already complied with legislation under the Smokefree Amendment Act which states organisations may allow smoking to take place in specified rooms or outside.
Only schools and kindergartens were stipulated by law in bans being allowed on grounds. Hospitals were not included, he said.
Francois questioned the motivation of the ban, saying it could set a precedent for the rest of the country.
He cited research in a international Cochrane Collaboration report and by Jodi Prochaska from the Center of Tobacco Control Research at Stanford University to argue that banning psychiatric patients from smoking had little&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;effect.
The latter study on psychiatric patients found all failed to give up smoking long term after a time of abstinence, Francois said.
"Psychiatric patients are even more unmotivated than the rest of the community."

	"link": "http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/8694385/Merrick-named-new-Phoenix-coach",
	"category": "sport/football",
	"content": "The Wellington Phoenix have appointed the A-League&rsquo;s most successful coach, Ernie Merrick, as their new head coach.
He replaces Ricki Herbert who left during the last season amid a run of poor results.
The club said Merrick&rsquo;s proven track record of two premierships, two championships and three grand final appearances gave him the edge in the talent search.
&ldquo;Ernie has an unrivalled record in the A-League, including two championships and another finals appearance, as well as being Hyundai A-League Coach of the Year twice with Melbourne Victory,&rdquo; Wellington Phoenix chairman Rob Morrison said.
&ldquo;His 12 years at the Victoria Institute of Sport, as well as his work with Melbourne Victory youth, demonstrates a proven track record in developing youth and bringing them through to the first team, something which is a core strategic pillar of the Phoenix. &nbsp;
&ldquo;He also fully understands the long term strategy the club is implementing and is supportive of that approach.&rdquo;
The Phoenix went through an exhaustive selection process. Candidates were required to articulate their football philosophy along with presenting the strategies and tactics they would employ if appointed Head Coach.
Morrison said Merrick&rsquo;s presentation highlighted what an outstanding coach he is.
&ldquo;Ernie&rsquo;s presentation showed that he has all the skills to lead the Phoenix to the top of the A-League,&rdquo; Morrison said.
&ldquo;His clearly articulated football philosophy and attention to detail was strongly underpinned by his sports science skills and that gave him a unique combination of attributes.
&ldquo;His skill set definitely gave him a distinct edge.
&ldquo;Another plus was that his knowledge of the A-League and its players is exceptional.&rdquo;
Merrick says that he is excited by the new challenge ahead and looks forward to building the Phoenix into a true A-League title contender.
&ldquo;My coaching philosophy has always been about winning. That&rsquo;s what I will be bringing to the Phoenix,&rdquo; Merrick, who has signed a two-year contract with an option for a third year, said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also happy to be back in the A-League.
&ldquo;I had six years at Victory but this is a new challenge entirely. It is unusual for one team to represent a country and it presents me with a great challenge.

	"title": "Twisters leave path of debris",
	"description": "A powerful storm in the US has spawned tornadoes that damaged homes and buildings near Oklahoma City and put the Tulsa area on high-alert.",
	"link": "http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/8694265/Twisters-leave-path-of-debris",
	"category": "world/americas",
	"content": "A powerful storm in the US has spawned tornadoes that damaged homes and buildings near Oklahoma City and put the Tulsa area on high-alert.
There were no immediate reports of injuries caused by any of the tornadoes that touched down in Oklahoma and Kansas, including one that hit the Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond before moving northeast toward Tulsa.
Last week storms sparked a series of tornadoes which killed several people in the  north Texas town of Granbury.
For days, forecasters had been warning about the possibility of tornadoes from a weekend storm, and emergency responders as far north as Minnesota and as far south as Texas were keeping a close eye on the powerful system pushing eastward and northward through the nation's breadbasket.
"I knew it was coming," said Randy Grau, who huddled with his wife and two young boys in their Edmond's home's safe room when the tornado hit. He said he peered out his window as the weather worsened and believed he saw a flock of birds heading down the street.
"Then I realised it was swirling debris. That's when we shut the door of the safe room, said Grau, adding that they sheltered in the room for 10 minutes.
In Wichita, Kansas, a tornado touched down near Mid-Content Airport on the city's southwest side, knocking out power to 7,500 homes and businesses but bypassing the most populated areas of Kansas' biggest city.
"At this point, there are very few reports of damage and no reports of fatalities or injuries, and we're very grateful for that," said Sedgwick County Emergency Management Director Randy Duncan.
In Oklahoma, aerial television news footage showed homes that appeared to have suffered significant damage northeast of Oklahoma City. Some outbuildings appeared to have been levelled, and some homes' roofs or walls had been knocked down.
"When I first drove into the neighbourhood, I didn't see any major damage until I pulled into the front of my house," said Csabe Mathe, of Edmond, who found a part of his neighbour's fence in his swimming pool. "My reaction was: I hope insurance pays for the cleaning."
"I typically have two trash cans, and now I have five in my driveway."
The Storm Prediction Center had been warning about severe weather in the region since last week.
"They've been calling for this all day," Edmond resident Anita Wright said after riding out the twister in an underground shelter. She and her husband Ed emerged from their hiding place to find uprooted trees, downed limbs and damaged gutters in their home.
In Katie Leathers' backyard, the family's trampoline was tossed through a section of fence and a giant tree uprooted.

	"category": "national",
	"content": "Passengers aboard a packed train that derailed and pushed a large tank through the floorboards of a carriage this morning have spoken about their ordeal.
The 7.43am train was on its way from Porirua to Wellington when it derailed at 8.14am near the Interislander ferry terminal.
KiwiRail said about 350 people were onboard the multiple-carriage Ganz Mavag and services on Kapiti, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa lines were postponed.
All emergency services were at the scene, with a handful of minor injuries reported so far.
Passenger Zoe Glasson said something came up through the floor of her carriage, cracking it.
"[It was] right next to where a bunch of school kids were standing. They were very lucky not to be hurt."
She said the carriage had been making strange noises since she boarded the train at Takapu Rd station.
"Just before the ferry terminal we heard the noise again but this time it became increasing louder and for the first time the train started moving. It shuddered and vibrated and then jumped up and down violently."
Ms Glasson said it definitely felt like the train could overturn.
"There were passengers screaming. When we came to rest we [were] skewed from out neighbouring carriages sideways, about half a metre."
Seeseei Molimau got on the train at Linden and noticed by Tawa a noise like the carriage was hitting gravel.
''We were hearing it was about to go. Through the tunnel it was running on stones and gravel.''
After Kaiwharawhara the sound got ''worse and worse'', she said.
After a loud sound the train derailed and a large round cylinder came up through the carriage floor.
''It wasn't going too fast, otherwise people would have been in a lot of trouble.''
''It was flipping scary, it was just so scary.''
She said it looked like a couple of people had symptoms of whiplash after the train came to an abrupt stop.
Payton Wright was also on the train and said: ''The train started shaking. There were rocks hitting the side of it [the train]. It felt like an earthquake.''
Fellow passenger Nina Wong said she thought the incident was an earthquake.
"There was debris falling just in front of me and one of the light covers came off ... The shaking lasted for about one to two minutes, getting worse as we kept moving, but then we came to a sudden stop."
Ms Wong said the passengers were told part of the train's wheel had come through the floor, causing it to crack.
On Twitter, Kate Barker said: "I think my train on the Waikanae line has just derailed," then followed with: "Turns out the back carriage has derailed. We're in the middle. Hope the folks at the back are ok!"
She then tweeted to followers: "well there was a lot of screeching and we've come to a holt. Still no word on what's happened."
Trains are operating on the Waikanae line up to Porirua and on the Hutt line up to Petone.
Buses are replacing all services between Porirua and Wellington and Petone and Wellington.

According to the <strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2326960/One-year-old-British-baby-survivor-Mecca-car-crash-BODY-BAG-taken-mortuary-rescuers-realised-alive.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a>,</strong> the then one-year-old was lucky to survive a crash in Saudi Arabia in February, in which the rest of his family was killed.
The family was on a 4800 kilometre pilgrimage to Mecca when the tragedy occurred.
Little Eisa Hayat was in a taxi with both his parents, his grandparents and an aunt, when it is thought the taxi driver fell asleep at the wheel and veered off the road, smashing into a concrete bridge.
According to the report, father Isshaq and mother Bilques, both 33, died in the smash. Bilques was seven-months-pregnant.
Grandfather Shaukat, 56, grandmother, Abida, 47, and aunt Saira Zenub, 29, were also killed. Saira had been due to get married.
Moments before the smash, she sent a relative a text message to say she was worried about how fast the taxi was going.
Medics on the scene believed Eisa was dead along with the rest of his family. Doctors were about to put him into a cold storage locker when they noticed his body bag moving.
They rushed the toddler, who has since turned two, to Medina Hospital, where he was treated for a dislocated shoulder and a broken arm and ribs.
It is thought he was able to survive because his grandfather used his body to shield him from the impact. He has since made a full recovery and is now being raised by relatives.&nbsp;

	"category": "entertainment/music",
	"content": "While emphasising the playful camaraderie  between the four X Factor judges, Stan Walker has called Daniel  Bedingfield out on his dramatic tendencies.
It follows Bedingfield calling Walker a soft touch due to his somewhat delicate way with even the least-talented contestants.
"In some ways I am," Walker said.
"But  he's a blimmin' emotional wreck - he cries more than the contestants.  People love him though. I am soft, but that's all right.
"We're all a little bit out there, but Daniel is definitely the craziest."
Disputing judges appear to be a guaranteed seat-filler for reality  music shows - Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj's endless altercations on the  latest American Idol series spring to mind - but Walker is quick to  assure New Zealand audiences that it's all in good fun.
"There are times when there's drama and disagreements amongst the  judges over a difference in opinion, but that's a given when you put  four strong personalities together," he said.
Walker revealed that besides his three over-25 contestants, he is a fan of youngsters Whenua Patuwai and Cassie Henderson.
"Cassie's a little pocket rocket. I hate that I love her," he said.
After  starring in New Zealand film Mt Zion, released early this year, and  taking over our TV screens on X Factor, Walker says the fan attention is  bordering on overwhelming.
"I do get recognised walking down the street and I try to hide to be honest," he said.
"There's a time and a place, and sometimes I just want to walk around and do my own thing without people watching."
Walker will be hoping the public scrutiny will translate into ticket  sales as he prepares for a tour of the country in September and October  this year.
He will be playing 31 shows touring from Whangarei to  Invercargill and is especially looking forward to performing in the  small towns throughout New Zealand.
"I'm a small town boy, I'm from a little village in the Mount [Maunganui] so I  always want people like me, people out in the country with not a lot  going on, to still get the experience and not miss out," he said.
The "Australian-born Maori boy", as he puts it, hypes his show as bigger and better than ever before.
"This is going to be me at my finest," he said
"It's  the best voice I've ever had, I will be performing all my songs, both  old and new, and there might be some special guests in the mix as well."
Who is willing to place bets on some of the X Factor stars entering stage left?

	"content": "A fake engineer who supervised construction of Christchurch's CTV building will not face criminal charges in Australia.
Australian Federal Police said this morning it would not investigate claims of fraud against Gerald Shirtcliff, who stole the identity of English engineer William Fisher.
An investigation last year found Shirtcliff used used Fisher's bachelor of engineering degree to enrol at New South Wales University in Sydney in 1972.
Shirtcliff, under the name William Fisher, obtained a masters in highway engineering in 1974 by which time he was working as an engineer and had become a member of Engineers Australia, again using the Fisher name and degree.
The University of New South Wales revoked the degree while Engineers Australia cancelled Shirtcliff's membership and referred his alleged fraud to the Australian Federal Police (AFP).
An Australian Federal Police spokeswoman said this morning police would not investigate the claims it received from Engineers Australia in November last year.
&lsquo;&lsquo;The matter was evaluated and no Commonwealth offences were identified.&rsquo;&rsquo;
Advice had been provided to New Zealand Police, which was also investigating Shirtcliff.
He told the royal commission of the inquiry into the Canterbury earthquakes he was a "graduate engineer".
He testified he had little to do with the construction of the CTV building, although other witnesses said he should have visited the site as frequently as once a day.
Stephen Durkin, chief executive officer of Engineers Australia, said his organisation had given Shirtcliff an opportunity to respond to the allegations before his membership was cancelled.
Shirtcliff, who claimed to have worked in senior positions on large engineering projects in Australia - including an 81-metre flagpole on Parliament House and a 33-storey Kings Cross building - had not responded, Durkin said.
At the time he was exposed, Shirtcliff was working as an engineer for multinational engineering companies in Brisbane where he lives. He was sacked immediately.
The CTV building was finished in about October 1987. It collapsed on during the 6.3-magnitude earthquake on February 22, 2011, killing 115 people. It was found to have serious construction defects. <br />Shirtcliff worked with English engineer William Fisher in South Africa in 1968-1969. During The Press investigation Shirtcliff provided Fisher's degree from the University of Sheffield to the newspaper and said it was his own.

	"category": "national/crime",
	"content": "A Northland family has been torn apart after a couple were allegedly shot by their nephew.
A 44-year-old man, understood to be Ivan Maheno, was killed yesterday morning at a property on Fairburn Rd, about 8 kilometres east of Kaitaia.
Carmen Maheno, his wife of two years and mother to their two sons, was believed to be the 38-year-old woman who was critically injured. She had since died at Whangarei Hospital, police said this morning.
Northland police - who have 22 officers working on the case - confirmed a 38-year-old man handed himself in at Kaitaia police station and would appear in the district court today charged with two counts of murder.
After the man handed himself in, the police went to Fairburn Road where they "located a terribly gruesome scene'', Detective Senior Sergeant Kevin Burke told Radio New Zealand.
Burke said police believed the deaths and injuries were the result of gunshot wounds but said autopsies would be done today. A full scene examination would also be conducted today.
Police are asking for information from anyone who was around 24a Fairburn Rd yesterday morning.
The habitation index lists the only resident of that property as Jesse Raymond Maheno.
Jabin Maheno - Ivan's cousin and a relative of Carmen's on his wife's side - said the victims' nephew was understood to be the person who handed himself in, but he did not want to name him until police confirmed it.
He said the nephew, who was brought up by a grandmother, had always been "a loner" and kept to himself.
"He's always been very quiet and never gave anyone any trouble," Jabin Maheno said.
He was unsure how close uncle and nephew were, and had no idea what the cause of the alleged shooting might be.
Jabin Maheno said Ivan was the "baby" of a huge family as the youngest of 16 or 17 kids, and many of those relatives had rushed to Whangarei Hospital to be by Carmen's bedside.
There were lot of extended family members also dotted around Australia, who would be "truly gutted", Jabin Maheno said. Ivan had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a few years ago but family said he "got on with life".
"He was always happy and got on well with everyone," Jabin Maheno said.
Another of Ivan's cousins, Neville Maheno, who lives down the road from where the alleged murder took place, said he saw police cars screaming down the road but had no idea it was anything to do with his family.

	"link": "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8693980/Threatening-letter-delays-parole-hearing",
	"category": "national/crime",
	"content": "The parole process for convicted fraudster Michael Swann is on hold after the parole board received a threatening letter from an unnamed supporter.
A Parole Board decision says it has deferred Michael Swann's parole hearing until its next meeting because of the letter which ''contains a threat to take and fund judicial review proceedings if Mr Swann does not receive an outcome favourable to him''.
The next hearing would take place before a different panel, it said.
The decision, signed by board convener Judge Michael Crosbie, said the letter was written by Swann's sponsor on parole, and represented ''an extraordinary turn of events'' as the board prepared to deliver a decision on whether Swann was to be&nbsp; paroled.
The unidentified writer of the letter had been one of Swann's supporters the day of his May 14 parole hearing, the document said.
''As is borne out by the letter, its writer was aware a decision was pending. It is both extraordinary and in appropriate for a prisoner or supporter to write a letter, such as that written by [the unnamed man] pending a decision.
''Having seen the letter, it would be wrong to ignore it ... it is the view of this panel that to proceed with a decision in relation to Mr Swann may well be seen to be responding to a threat.''
Judge Crosbie said contents of the letter raised issues of risk to the board.
''Mr Swann is the perpetrator of 'fraud on a grand scale', to quote the sentencing judge, involving a serious and cynical breach of trust.
''[The unnamed sponsor] is Mr Swann's principal sponsor both for work and accommodation'' ... and ''appears&nbsp; to object to any level of independent inquiry or analysis by the Board as to matters that go to risk".
''That objection, together with [his] relatively skewed view of the parole hearing and parole process, is something the board needs to consider for the purpose of assessing the suitability of the release proposal.''

	"category": "national/health",
	"content": "When Wellington mother Jane Temel watched her nine-year-old son die of asthma she had the option of getting "bitter or better".
With two other asthma-suffering sons to care for, Temel and her husband Nick chose to get better at recognising asthma symptoms. There was no time to be consumed by blame, self-pity and anger, she said.
On July 11, 2007, Charlie turned 9 and for the year prior his asthma symptoms had stayed at bay, but that winter he couldn't shake a virus and persistent cough.
On August 17, Charlie was kept home from school after a rough night's sleep, but hospital didn't seem necessary so Temel left him with her visiting parents and headed to work.
Charlie had breakfast and a shower and started working on a school project when he unexpectedly stood up and collapsed.
Husband Nick, who had been dropping their younger son, Oskar, now 10, off at school, returned home to find paramedics trying to revive Charlie.
Just over 24 hours later the Temels made the difficult decision to turn off his life support.
"That's how quickly it can happen," Temel said.
Today is the start of Asthma Awareness week - and before the week is through at least one more New Zealander will have died from the illness.
Temel now knows that pollen was a trigger for Charlie. She later discovered that the night before he got ill there had been a significant increase in pollen.
Her advice to parents is to record everything about their child's environment.
"Record when they get sick, the times of year they're worse, any viruses they get, anything unusual or different in their diet and their environment."
Asthma Foundation medical adviser Dr Kyle Perrin said everyone's asthma was different and sufferers were at the mercy of their environment.
"Allergies are a really massive driver for a lot of people with asthma and pollen counts are a factor, but you just have to get on and try to live life to the full in those surroundings."
He said asthma and allergy sufferers had become more prevalent and the Western world had always ranked higher than other countries.
"There are more people with asthma and although people still die from it, we're getting better at treating it as well.
"We don't know why there is regional variation with asthma sufferers but low socio-economic areas with cold, damp and mouldy housing is still a big contributor to hospital admissions," he said.
800,000 &ndash; New Zealanders affected by asthma
550,000 &ndash; the estimated number of school days Kiwi asthma sufferers miss each year
$800 million &ndash; the conservative estimate of the economic burden of asthma in New Zealand each year
235 million &ndash; people worldwide are affected by asthma and the number is rising
250,000 &ndash; the estimated number of deaths annually worldwide

	"category": "national",
	"content": "Carole Grant has stopped crying when she thinks of her missing son, Leighton.
But the Taupo mother won't stop trying to find out where he is, and whether he is dead or still alive.
Grant has not seen her son since January 25, when he left her house on what she thought was a camping trip for a few days.
"The last thing he said to me was he would not need any money."
The chances of finding him alive are diminishing but she holds a strong hope his body will be found - so she can say goodbye to her youngest son.
Extensive searches on land, water and air by police, LandSAR, family and friends have failed to locate the 35-year-old security worker.
Police and Navy told her that searching for her son in Lake Taupo was impractical given the size of the search area.
It would just not be possible to grid search every centimetre of the lakebed using a navy sonar device, she said.
Four months on, and less than a fortnight until Leighton's 36th birthday, Grant wants to appeal again to anyone who may have seen her son in the Taupo area in late January.
Grant said there were a lot of holidaymakers in Taupo during Auckland Anniversary Weekend when Leighton disappeared.
"Someone must have seen him swimming."
Her hopes were raised recently when two fishermen snagged and then lost an unidentified object 600 metres off the Hatepe river mouth and 50m deep.
Grant's Suzuki Vitara, which Leighton borrowed, was found four days after he left her house parked between trees near Hatepe, 15 kilometres south of Taupo.
A day later searchers found his wetsuit, a knife and Grant's engagement ring among items on Motutaiko Island, around 3km from the beach.
Police dogs picked up a scent on the island which led back to the shore, she said.
It indicated he may have swum to the island, left his belongings on the island and possibly drowned swimming back.
"There are times when I really want to do something more to find Leighton but we have tried every angle.
"I just think that someone just might have seen him but have not come forward with any information yet."
Grant left a partner and five children, aged 1 to 13. His mental health was fragile before his disappearance, his mother said.
Before he left he scribbled a note to his 8-year-old son, Archie, that he loved him and was sorry he couldn't say goodbye.
"He was staying with me because he was having problems. He said 'Mum, I need your help'.
"He came down from Auckland so we could try and work out some goals together.
"It's a mystery. It's unreal what has happened... I don't think he is alive, I'd just like to find his body."

	"content": "In a flash, it was gone. New Zealand boldly dared to dream of a rare test win at Lord's but in the space of one horror hour it became a nightmare.
Requiring 239 to beat England after an outstanding 10-wicket match haul by Tim Southee, New Zealand were right in their chase - for about five overs.
Then the lanky figure of Stuart Broad awoke to produce one of his rare, unplayable spells and New Zealand&rsquo;s batsmen were frozen to the spot.
The tourists folded for 68 in 22.3 overs as England cantered to a 170-run victory leaving skipper Brendon McCullum standing in Lord's outfield trying to make sense of a horror hour, only matched by the first morning at Cape Town in January.&nbsp;
"It&rsquo;s pretty tough to explain at this point. For so long in this game we were up with the play and at times we were dictating terms," he said.
"Within an hour the game turned on its head and England continued to grow in confidence as they kept picking up regular wickets. Our confidence started to subside and the difference between the two teams came down to that one hour of madness."
With England paceman Broad breathing fire and hauling in 7-44, New Zealand were skittled for 68.
Their chase for what appeared a very gettable 239 to win lasted just 114 minutes, ending an absorbing, seesawing test in the most brutal circumstances, midway through the fourth day.
When McCullum was lbw to Broad for eight, his second failure of the test, New Zealand staggered to lunch on 29-6, their chase over.
It revived memories of the collapse for 45 against South Africa in January, albeit in the first innings rather than the fourth.
"There was plenty of calm about the guys in the changing room and we weren't able to transfer that out to the middle. We've had many of these experiences before and I think we've put distance between the last time we felt this sort of pain," McCullum said.
&ldquo;We've taken some significant steps forward in the last little while but today was undoubtedly a step backwards."
McCullum said the batsmen shouldered some of the blame but he paid tribute to Broad who bowled full and fast.
"You&rsquo;ve got to give credit where credit&rsquo;s due and Stuart Broad&rsquo;s spell of bowling was high class. He swung the ball beautifully, he was able to get the odd ball to hold its line up the slope and his lengths were impeccable. He bowled at reasonable pace as well and we weren&rsquo;t able to work out a way to get through it."
The question is now, what kind of psychological damage this causes to New Zealand heading into Friday's second and final test at Leeds.
Memories of the Cape Town collapse for 45 in January had almost faded. This pavilion procession revived them as New Zealand slumped to 29-6 at lunch, with Broad taking five of the first six.

	"description": "Some lucky person walked into a Publix supermarket in suburban Florida over the past few days and bought a ticket now worth an estimated US$590.5 million (NZ$712.56m) - the highest Powerball jackpot in history.",

	"content": "Some lucky person walked into a Publix supermarket in suburban Florida over the past few days and bought a ticket now worth an estimated US$590.5 million (NZ$712.56m) - the highest Powerball jackpot in history.
It's an amount too high for many to imagine. Compare it to the budget for the city of Zephyrhills: This year's figure is just more than US$49 million. The winning Powerball jackpot is 12 times that.
Whoever has the ticket still hadn't come forward.
"This would be the sixth Florida Powerball winner and right now, it's the sole winner of the largest ever Powerball jackpot," Florida Lottery executive Cindy O'Connell said. "We're delighted right now that we have the sole winner."
Publix spokeswoman Maria Brous said there were a lot of rumours about who won, but the store didn't know.
"We're excited for the winner or winners," said Brous. "We don't promote or endorse the lottery, we offer it as a convenience."
Florida Lottery spokesman David Bishop said it was doubtful the winner would come forward that day. The ticket-holder couldn't claim the prize until Monday when the agency opened, he said.
"It never happens this quickly," Bishop said. "If they know they won, they're going to contact their attorney or an accountant first so they can get their affairs in order."
O'Connell said Florida has had more Powerball winners than any other state but did not give any indication whether anyone had stepped forward with the winning ticket in Saturday's drawing.
But plenty of people in Zephyrhills - population 13,337 - were wondering whether it's someone they know.
Joan Albertson drove over to the Publix early Sunday morning with her camera in hand, just in case the winner emerged. She said she had bought a ticket at a store across the street, and the idea of winning that much money was still something of a shock.
"Oh, there's so much good that you could do with that amount of money." Albertson said. "I don't even know where to begin."
Zephyrhills is a small city in Pasco County, about 50 kilometres northeast of downtown Tampa. Once a rural farming town, it was now known as a hotbed for skydiving activity, and the home to large retiree mobile home parks and Zephyrhills bottled water.
And now, one lucky lottery ticket.
Sara Jeltis said her parents in Michigan texted her with the news Sunday morning.
"Well, it didn't click 'til I came here," she said, gesturing to the half-dozen TV live trucks humming in the Publix parking lot. "And I'm like, wow I can't believe it, it's shocking. Out of the whole country, this Publix, in little Zephyrhills would be the winner."
With four out of every five possible combinations of Powerball numbers in play, lottery executives said on Saturday that someone was almost certain to win the game's highest jackpot, a windfall of hundreds of millions of dollars - and that's after taxes.
The winning numbers were 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11.
Estimates had earlier put the jackpot at around US$600 million. But Powerball's online site said on Sunday that the jackpot had reached an estimated US$590.5 million.

	"link": "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/8691918/Female-specialists-put-pressure-on-system",
	"category": "national/health",
	"content": "An increasing number of female medical specialists is putting district health boards under growing pressure because women work less than men, a senior doctors' advocate says.
Association of Salaried Medical Specialists [ASMS] executive director Ian Powell says recruitment pressures are escalating because female medical specialists work less than men and want a better work-life balance.
But a female medical specialist at Waikato Hospital said while women might want different things, they are definitely pulling their weight in the health sector.
Powell's comments came during a briefing to Parliament on the changing demographic of the medical workforce.
He said several aspects should compel health boards to recruit and retain specialists, one of which is the proportion of women specialists is increasing.
In 2011, 27 per cent of the specialist workforce was female - up from 19 per cent in 2000 and 13 per cent in 1990, according to ASMS.
The numbers suggest the trend is continuing. In 2011, 52 per cent of registrars were female. Because females tend to work fewer hours than males, the working-life contribution for female medical practitioners, when measured in total time worked, is estimated about 80 per cent of that of a male.
"This must be taken into account in projected workforce requirements," Powell said.
Raewyn Fisher, a Waikato Hospital cardiologist  - the only female specialist in a department of 13 - said it was no secret female doctors were more inclined to choose general practice and specialist areas that might be more suited to working part time. These positions also allowed breaks for having children.
"As specialty training is longer, more intense and usually involves overseas training, this can be a deterrent to many. This training is usually done during their 20s, when many prefer to start their family," she said.
"Having said that, it is helpful that these days there are more women with partners who are able and willing to take a more active role in child-rearing.
"Once women become specialists, none of us would say we opt for less time on call or expect reduced hours or clinical responsibility just because we are mums.
"We do have to be like the boys and put in a lot of time and effort to make it to the higher levels in this profession.
"In some specialties women used to have to work harder than males to prove themselves as equals. Fortunately most specialties have moved on from this."

	"description": "Tourists will be allowed to sleep overnight in Christchurch International Airport once again this week - but only if they can prove they are catching an early flight.",

	"category": "national",
	"content": "Tourists will be allowed to sleep overnight in Christchurch International Airport once again this week - but only if they can prove they are catching an early flight.
The airport attracted controversy by closing and "clearing" its international terminal between midnight and 5am after discovering up to 200 commuters were choosing to sleep there instead of booking accommodation for a night.
Tourists were sleeping in bus shelters and stairwells only to be moved on from airport grounds.
Airport chief executive Jim Boult said that from Wednesday people would be allowed to stay overnight at the airport again, once airport refurbishments were finished, but staff would "strictly police it".
The airport would allow only people travelling early the next morning to stay - "not people who are abusing the system by staying as many as 11 nights in a row".
"We are not a place for free accommodation, we are a place for people to wait for departing flights or wait for a passenger coming in," Boult said.
Boult said tourists had been found cooking food in the toilets, "lying all over the floor", setting up tents, drinking alcohol and abusing staff.
Boult also said they were planning to build affordable backpacker accommodation on airport land. He hopes to announce a deal in the next two months.
Closing the airport at night divided opinion and attracted many comments <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8688281/Tourists-land-to-rude-Kiwi-awakening" target="_blank">online</a>.
Some said the move was "mean spirited", while others were critical of people sleeping in the airport.
"Rent a room, you bums," wrote one commenter.
South Island tourism groups rushed to support the airport, saying people should find motels instead.
"We want to make sure people have the best experiences of the South Island possible and kipping in the airport is not one of those," Tourism Dunedin chief executive Hamish Saxton said.

	"title": "'Miscommunication' delays meat exports",
	"description": "Meat exports to China are held up because of a "miscommunication" and a Chinese official here is confident it can be resolved quickly.",
	"link": "http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/sheep/8691750/Miscommunication-delays-meat-exports",
	"category": "business/farming",
	"content": "Meat exports to China are held up because of a "miscommunication" and a Chinese official here is confident it can be resolved quickly.
On Friday it emerged that New Zealand meat products had been held up in Chinese ports, possibly for weeks.
Reports suggested the name change from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to the Ministry of Primary Industries was behind the hold up.
China's economic and commercial consul Zhang Fan said today that the delay was likely due to a "small mistake" on the New Zealand side, and it was wrong to say meat exports to China had been blocked.
"I think probably there's just a miscommunication," Zhang said.
"I think probably they just haven't passed on the information as quickly as possible to the relevant Chinese authorities."
Zhang said he was "quite confident" the issue could be resolved quickly but he could not say how long that would be, saying: "They have to go through a kind of procedure, just the normal kind of bureaucratic process."
Zhang had not been able to get an update from officials in Beijing because of time differences, but pointed to the free trade agreement and New Zealand's rising exports to China and said there was a "very good" framework for discussing issues.
"A lot of products actually export into China very quickly," he said.
"China is such a big market . . . for dairy and also your wine, also some fruits like kiwifruit."
Quarantine procedures for meat were strict around the world because of the potential risks, but other countries' products had continued to enter China, Zhang said.
"If there's some mistakes in the process, I think probably the border officials will stop the trade, that's quite understandable," he said.
Other countries hadn't had problems because they had followed the proper procedure.
"I think it's just a small mistake on your part," he said.
Earlier today Prime Minister John Key said China fast-tracking sign offs on Kiwi meat plants was behind the block.
Some industry sources speculated it could be protectionism by Chinese authorities who were using the certification change as a pretext to protect local pork and poultry industries, despite New Zealand having a free trade agreement with China.
But the problem was more of an indication of how close New Zealand's relationship with China was, Key told RadioLive.
He said in his recent trip to China, he put pressure on the country to authorise a few of New Zealand's production plants because of the high quality.
"The Chinese accommodated us, but the paperwork hadn't caught up," he told RadioLive.

	"title": "NZ close to Taiwan free trade agreement",
	"description": "New Zealand is poised to sign its first free trade agreement in more than three years, with an announcement of a deal with Taiwan expected in the coming months.",
	"link": "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8691400/NZ-close-to-Taiwan-free-trade-agreement",
	"category": "national/politics",
	"content": "New Zealand is poised to sign its first free trade agreement in more than three years, with an announcement of a deal with Taiwan expected in the coming months.
Sources say negotiations have been progressing smoothly and the most complicated issues, including the vexed issue of Taiwan's complicated relationship with mainland China, are already largely resolved.
Assuming it is completed, it would be the first deal concluded since a closer economic partnership was announced with Hong Kong in March 2010.
While New Zealand does not officially recognise Taiwan as a country, it is our 12th largest trading partner, having spent years in the top 10.
The island nation of 23 million people imported more than $800 million worth of products from New Zealand in the year to June 2012, and was the source of more than 18,000 tourists.
The deal could be worth ''tens of millions'' a source estimated, with the biggest winners likely to be producers of dairy products, meat, kiwifruit and in particular apples, where a drop in tariff could be ''transformational''.
Despite the lengthy trade relations, exporters often face tariffs of around 20 per cent in Taiwan.
Factors said to have complicated the passing of the deal are both New Zealand's relations with China, where trade has soared since a free trade agreement was reached, and Taiwan's own trade negotiations with mainland China.
Officially, both Taiwan and China claim sovereignty over the other, a situation which has maintained since the Communist Party took control of mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in 1949.
China makes adhering to a One-China policy a pre-condition of diplomatic relations.
New Zealand's relations with Taiwan are now maintained through an office of the Wellington Employers Chamber of Commerce of Taipei.
Sources say the issue of free trade with Taiwan was raised when Prime Minister John Key led a major trade delegation to China in April, as part of an established ''no surprises'' policy of keeping Beijing informed of our relations with China.
Trade Minister Tim Groser declined to comment.

	"content": "One single ticket in Florida has matched all the numbers to win the highest Powerball lottery jackpot in history at an estimated US$590.5 million (NZ$710m), officials said.
The lone winner was sold at a supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to Florida Lottery executive Cindy O&rsquo;Connell.
The winner was not immediately identified publicly and she did not give any indication hours after Saturday&rsquo;s (NZT Sunday) drawing whether anyone had already stepped forward with the ticket.
With four out of every five possible combinations of numbers in the multistate lottery in play, someone is almost sure to win the game&rsquo;s highest jackpot, a windfall of hundreds of millions of dollars &mdash; and that&rsquo;s after taxes. Saturday night&rsquo;s winning numbers were 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11.
Estimates had earlier put the jackpot at about US$600m (NZ$720m). But Powerball&rsquo;s online site said that its latest tabulation of the tickets sold put the estimated jackpot at about an estimated US$590.5m (NZ$710m).
Terry Rich, CEO of the Iowa Lottery, confirmed that the Powerball grand prize jackpot &mdash; based on the winner sold in Florida &mdash; had been reset at an estimated US$40m (NZ$48m), or about US$25.1m (NZ$30m) cash value if a lump sum were elected.
The chances of winning the prize were astronomically low: 1 in 175.2 million. That&rsquo;s how many different ways you could combine the numbers. But lottery officials estimated that about 80 per cent of those possible combinations had been purchased recently.
&lsquo;&lsquo;This would be the roll to get in on,&rsquo;&rsquo; Rich had said before the drawing, noting there were no guarantees and that&rsquo;s &lsquo;&lsquo;the randomness of it, and the fun of it&rsquo;&rsquo;.
That didn&rsquo;t deter people across Powerball-playing states - 43 plus Washington, DC, and the US Virgin Islands - from lining up at gas stations and convenience stores Saturday for their chance at striking it filthy rich.
At a mini market in the heart of Los Angeles&rsquo; Chinatown, employees broke the steady stream of customers into two lines: One for Powerball ticket buyers and one for everybody else. Some people appeared to be looking for a little karma.
&lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve had two winners over US$10 million here over the years, so people in the neighborhood think this is the lucky store,&rsquo;&rsquo; employee Gordon Chan said as he replenished a stack of lottery tickets on a counter.

	"content": "Rethink the plan or rethink the council. This was the unanimous message from 500 Aucklanders gathered tonight at Takapuna Grammar School to discuss Auckland Council&rsquo;s intensification plans.
The meeting was organised by resident-led group Auckland 2040 whose goal was to encourage 50,000 people to give feedback to the council on what they believed was a &ldquo;haphazard, scatter-gun&rdquo; approach to intensification.
Founders, Richard Burton, a resource management consultant, and Guy Haddleton, argued that contrary to what the council was claiming, 56 per cent of the residential area in Auckland would be zoned to allow apartments.
Following a city-wide resident revolt over the last fortnight, Mayor Len Brown has already announced that four areas of the plan would be revised.
But those present at the meeting were unanimous in calling for the entire plan to be revisited and looked at &lsquo;&lsquo;from the ground up&rdquo;.
This would include investigating what areas were appropriate for intensification in terms of infrastructure and character.
&ldquo;We have got to keep holding the mayor&rsquo;s feet to the fire,&rdquo; said Haddleton.
&ldquo;We need to slow this process down until we get it right.&rdquo;
The lone voice in support of the plan, councillor Ann Hartley, was shut down by angry residents who booed her claims that the council was willing and ready to listen to public feedback.
