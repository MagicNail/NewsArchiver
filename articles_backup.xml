		<content>The Serious Fraud Office has laid 48 charges under the Crimes Act against a group of people allegedly involved in a complex series of mortgage frauds involving about $9.2 million. At the centre of the charges is 44-year-old Eli Devoy (who now goes by the name of Ellie Stone). The SFO alleges Devoy conducted a series of property sales and purchases between July 2007 and December 2010 which deceived various banks into approving mortgage applications, which were based on false documents or information supplied to the banks. Other defendants are six individuals related to, or associated with, Devoy who are alleged to have participated in the scheme. "Financial crime in lending markets increases the cost of credit to all borrowers and has a direct impact on economic growth," acting SFO chief executive Simon McArley said. "SFO is keen to work with lenders to reduce offending in this area and augment the deterrent effects of SFO's prosecution functions with improved lending practices and procedures." A complaint about Devoy and her associates was first received by the SFO in November 2011 and an investigation launched the following month.</content>

		<category>world/europe</category>
		<content>A man seen with bloody hands wielding a butcher's knife after the killing of a British soldier on the streets of London was described as a convert to Islam who took part in demonstrations with a banned radical group, two Muslim hard-liners say. Police raided houses in connection with the brazen slaying of the off-duty soldier on Wednesday (local time), identified as Lee Rigby, of the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, who served in Afghanistan. In addition to the two suspects who were hospitalised after being shot by police, authorities said they had arrested a man and a woman, both 29, on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Police would not say whether it appeared Rigby had been targeted specifically because of his military service. Although he was not in uniform at the time he was killed, he was said by witnesses to be wearing a T-shirt for a British veterans' charity. Anjem Choudary, the former head of the radical group al-Muhajiroun, told The Associated Press that the man depicted in startling video footage that emerged after Rigby's death was named Michael Adebolajo, a Christian who converted to Islam around 2003 and took part in several demonstrations by the group in London. The BBC broadcast video from 2007 showing Adebolajo standing near Choudary at a rally. Omar Bakri Muhammad, who now lives in Lebanon but had been a radical Muslim preacher in London, also said he recognised the man seen on TV as Adebolajo and said he attended his London lectures in the early 2000s. Police have not identified either of the two wounded suspects and have not said when they would do so. Authorities in Britain usually wait to name suspects after they have been charged. Bakri, speaking from Lebanon, said he remembers Adebolajo as a "shy person" who was keen to learn about Islam and asked interesting questions. "He used to listen more than he spoke," Bakri said. "I was very surprised to learn that he is the suspect in the attack." Mary Warder, who has lived in the Woolwich area for more than 30 years, told the AP said she had seen both of the suspects preaching on the streets. Shopkeepers, however, said they couldn't remember seeing them. The two men suspected of killing the 25-year-old Rigby had been part of previous investigations by security services, a British official said on Thursday (local time), as investigators searched several locations and tried to determine whether the men were part of a wider terrorist plot. There also was no clear indication on when or where the suspects may have been radicalised. Rigby, the father of a 2-year-old boy, was slain outside the Royal Artillery Barracks in the Woolwich area of south London while horrified bystanders watched in the busy city known for its decorum. The bizarre scene was recorded on witnesses' cellphones, with one of the two suspects boasting of their exploits and warning of more violence as the soldier lay on the ground. Holding bloody knives and a meat cleaver, they waited for the arrival of police, who shot them in the legs, according to a passerby who tried to save the dying soldier.</content>

		<title>High commissioner paying $7500-a-week rent</title>
		<description>Lockwood Smith is living in rented digs at a cost of $7500 a week, as the Government plans to sell its swanky high commissioner's residence in London.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8712968/High-commissioner-paying-7500-a-week-rent</link>
		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>Lockwood Smith is living in rented digs at a cost of $7500 a week, as the Government plans to sell its swanky high commissioner's residence in London. The former Speaker arrived to take up the high commissioner post in February after nearly three decades as an MP. He has settled into diplomatic life well, flamboyantly hosting functions and having an audience with the Queen. But instead of moving into the plush Clareville St high commissioner's property in the upmarket suburb of Kensington, he has been staying in leased accommodation in the same neighbourhood. The cost was £ 4000 (NZ$7500) a week, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said yesterday. "London has some of the most expensive property in the world and the cost of the lease is in line with what you would expect to pay for properties in that area, " he said. The spokesman said the accommodation was used for a range of functions as well as being Dr Smith's home and confirmed Dr Smith was not offered the official high commissioner's residence. That was because "prior to his taking up his appointment the decision was made to sell the property rather than undertake the refurbishment that would be needed in the near future". The property did not form part of the ministry's long-term plans for the post, he said. The ministry was also deciding what to do with New Zealand House, the 18-storey building in central London which the Government has under lease until 2048. The office building, which houses the high commission and other government agencies, needs substantial repairs. Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully last year put a planned $2 million upgrade on hold following budget cuts within the ministry. It is understood officials are considering turning the top floor of NZ House into a penthouse apartment for the high commissioner, and the spokesman said Dr Smith would live in leased premises until a decision was made. Labour foreign affairs spokesman Phil Goff said there was no reason Dr Smith could not stay in the high commissioner's house until it was sold. "If they were intending to sell, then surely the high commissioner could live in the property pending the sale of the property and save taxpayers' money," he said. The four-bedroom home, valued at £ 5.5m, was bought about 10 years ago under the former Labour government, while Goff was foreign minister. He recalls staying there, and said it was suitable, modern and well presented.</content>

		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>Two men charged with murder after a man died in hospital from burns have been remanded in custody. Jason Alistor Barr, 42, and Shay Barry Webster, 20, are charged with murdering Terrance Martin Smith in an attack on Anzac Day. They had previously been held in custody on assault charges while Smith was transferred to Middlemore Hospital in Auckland, after being badly burnt in Christchurch. Police announced a week ago that Barr and Webster were being charged with murder. The pair made their first appearances on that charge in the Christchurch District Court before Judge Philip Moran today. Webster was remanded in custody to a post-committal conference on July 26 and Barr was remanded in custody for an appearance in court by audio-visual link from the prison on June 14. The police withdrew the previous assault charges against both men. No bail applications were made for the men by defence counsel.</content>

		<title>Abuse claims at 'seriously dysfunctional' care home</title>
		<description>A patient was allegedly forced to kneel for hours in a garage with his nose against the wall at a ''seriously dysfunctional'' residence for the intellectually disabled.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8712369/Abuse-claims-at-seriously-dysfunctional-care-home</link>
		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>A patient was allegedly forced to kneel for hours in a garage with his nose against the wall at a ''seriously dysfunctional'' residence for the intellectually disabled. The man also complained that he was kicked, beaten and videotaped by staff, who an inquiry later found were abusing and neglecting their highly-dependant clients. Revelations of the widespread abuse, perpetrated at government-funded homes for the intellectually impaired across the upper North Island, follow an investigation that uncovered a litany of horrors at a residence in South Auckland, including a disabled boy who was left alone in a paddock to eat grass. Reports of failings at that facility, Parklands, prompted Health Minister Tony Ryall to order a review of the auditing, monitoring and accreditation of all residential disability providers. However, Ryall has so far refused to discuss the failings or the review. He will not answer questions directly about each case and refuses to comment on what kind of sanctions may be in order for either ministry staff or the owners and managers of each residence. Latest Ministry of Health documents reveal that concerns from health professionals about the neglect of clinical care at facilities run by the Te Roopu Taurima O Manukau Trust, a nationwide provider, went unanswered for up to two years. At the same time, clients were physically assaulted by ''untrained and unsuitable'' staff - some who were former prisoners - who allegedly treated the residents more like inmates than patients. Te Roopu Taurima caters to nearly 300 intellectually disabled clients, with 500 staff, across 54 residences located in Auckland, Northland, Waikato and Canterbury. Among its patients are those placed in compulsory care by the courts, many of whom have extremely high needs and present challenging behaviour. The abuses of some of those clients were uncovered when two Auckland-based patients made allegations against staff members in early 2011. The ministry would not release the full complaints to Fairfax NZ but briefing notes released under the Official Information Act revealed one man complained he was kicked, hit and choked, had hot water thrown on him, was sworn at and made to sit in the corner as punishment. Staff videotaped him while they ''restrained'' him, the man claimed. He also told his legal representatives he was made to kneel in a garage for long periods with his nose against the wall. A letter in early 2011 from two doctors at the regional psychiatry service revealed other patients had bruising, had spoken of assaults, were not being given medication, and were being exposed to risky situations where they had access to drugs and alcohol. Previous attempts to raise these concerns had gone unanswered.</content>

		<title>Yurt dweller's 'tactical retreat'</title>
		<description>After eight years of living in an unpermitted 37sqm yurt, Kris Kolff moved into his new accommodation last night - a campervan.</description>

		<category>life-style/home-living</category>
		<content>but that he could live in a "tiny" campervan on her property legally for two months and then move into a different campervan for another two months. "The building inspector actually suggested that to us - that if we had six campervans we'd be legal. They were trying to be helpful it's absurd," she said. Kolff said his yurt had been a wonderful home and ever since he moved to Wantoo Wantoo - the property's whimsical name based on its address - he had never given a thought to living elsewhere. He owns a house in Nelson, now occupied by his son and his family, but said: "I don't want to live there any more. It's not that I can't afford to I just really want to live here." West Bank Rd neighbour and yurt expert Remko Ros said the yurt, a portable tent-like structure traditionally used by nomads, and its wool insulation was in great shape and made for affordable accommodation. "You've got 37msq of living space for $10,000. It's been standing here for eight years with high winds and it hasn't budged." Jager said it was ironic to hear the Government talking about affordable housing: "We're not just talking about it, we've done it." Jager and her partner Jan-Albert Droppers had charges brought against them by the TDC for breaches of the Resource Management Act and failing to comply with the Building Act, following their alleged failure to comply with last year's Environment Court order around illegal dwellings on the property. They have been summonsed to appear in the Nelson District Court on Wednesday on two charges each, in relation to the yurt and a strawbale cottage being deemed to be illegal dwellings. By the end of Thursday, Kolff would be moved into a campervan and the family in the straw bale cottage were to be living in a house bus. Jager said that they had notified the council of their intent to comply and it was the council's duty to inform the court that they were now in compliance. She hoped the council would then stay the court proceedings, although she and Droppers would appear if the hearing went ahead next Wednesday. Council environment and planning manager Dennis Bush-King said earlier in the week that the council was left with no option but to advise the court the couple had failed to comply with the order, and bring the charges. He would not be drawn on whether the charges might be withdrawn in the event the couple complied. Jager said her family and others living at Wantoo Wantoo had received "amazing support" from all over the country in the past week and that their compliance was a tactical retreat.</content>

		<content>Today's break from the run of unsettled weather that has affected most of the country is expected to be shortlived, particularly for the north of the North Island. MetService said rain and strengthening northerlies were expected to spread over northern parts of the North Island tomorrow, with some heavy falls tomorrow night and early Sunday morning. Areas receiving the most rain were expected to be northern and eastern parts of Northland and Bay of Plenty, from tomorrow afternoon through to Sunday morning, and northern Taranaki, Waikato, Waitomo and northern parts of Taupo from tomorrow evening through to Sunday morning. "These areas may experience localised heavy falls and squally conditions in possible thunderstorms during Saturday evening and early Sunday," MetService said. A high over the country was moving away to the east. It was being followed by a low pressure system approaching from the northern Tasman Sea and a series of cold fronts moving in from the southern oceans.</content>

		<category>national</category>
		<content>Death has not stopped adventurer Paddy Freaney reaching the summit of Mt Everest. At 10.58am yesterday (NZ time), Freaney and wife Rochelle Rafferty stood atop the highest peak on earth. Rafferty is now only the fifth New Zealand woman to stand on the summit of Mt Everest. Freaney passed away last year, but that has done nothing to quell his exploits. Rafferty has carried her partner of 20 years all the way from the Upper Waimak Basin to the Himalayas in a small canister. Reaching the summit fulfilled a lifelong desire for the couple. They had planned to travel to Everest base camp in 2011, but just before they were due to leave, Freaney was diagnosed with terminal cancer. On that trip Rafferty was considering trying for the summit. Freaney, who rose to national fame in 1993 when he snapped a blurry photograph of a moa-like creature near Arthur's Pass, had previously attempted Everest three times. The first two attempts were thwarted by bad On the third, he injured his ankle while training in Nepal. Freaney's ashes were not scattered at the summit, which is held sacred by Buddhists and many Nepalese.</content>

		<title>Williams calls time on All Blacks career</title>
		<description>Ali Williams is quitting test rugby, ending an 11-year stint in the All Blacks.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/8712429/Williams-calls-time-on-All-Blacks-career</link>
		<category>sport/rugby</category>
		<content>Ali Williams is quitting test rugby, ending an 11-year stint in the All Blacks. Williams announced his retirement via social media this morning, tweeting: "It's that time." He then provided a link to Telly, a site labelled the web's TV, where he posted a short video, confirming he was standing down from the international game. "Guys, I just want to let you know first that I'm retiring from international rugby," he said. "I'm hanging up the black jersey. It's been an amazing 10 years but it's time to call it quits. "But I'm not hanging up the boots yet." Williams played his first test in 2002 against England and went on to earn 77 caps and played in three World Cups including winning the tournament in 2011. The big lock has been plagued by injuries, with two Achilles operations biting into his test career. The 32-year-old has been in rejuvenated form this year for the Blues where the captaincy has brought out the best in him. He was named in the All Blacks wider training squad that was in a three-day camp in Mt Maunganui earlier this week. But Williams has clearly seen the writing on the wall – that his experience alone will not be enough to hold off the young brigade as the next crucial steps in planning the defence of the World Cup in 2015 are put in place. The All Blacks now have three outstanding young locks in Sam Whitelock, Luke Romano and Brodie Retallick who have quickly garnered enough test experience to bring confidence in the second row stocks moving forward. Crusaders lock Dominic Bird is seen as the next cab off the rank. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has said this was likely to be a transitional year where tough decisions would be required around some ageing stars. Williams is the first of those to put his hand up. Williams was a consistent performer for the All Blacks where he brought athleticism to go with the usual roles of the tight-five department. His best season for the All Blacks was in 2008 when he shrugged off the World Cup disaster of the previous year to play 15 tests and be the iron man of the pack. But injuries hit him after that and he didn't reappear in the black jersey again until 2011, when he forced his way back in for the winning World Cup effort. Knee problems surfaced last year that saw him play the opening two tests against Ireland but then sit out the Rugby Championship. He retained the faith of the selectors by gaining a place on the end-of-year tour but was clearly in a secondary role. Williams must now decide whether he will stay on at his beloved Blues or take his game offshore where his good form and improved fitness over this year will still give him some appeal to the rich foreign clubs. The accolades came thick and fast for Williams as his decision was made public.</content>

		<title>London terror victim's identity revealed</title>
		<description>The soldier who was butchered to death on a south London street has been named as 25-year-old father Lee Rigby.</description>

		<category>world/europe</category>
		<content>The soldier who was butchered to death on a south London street has been named as 25-year-old father Lee Rigby. The Afghan war veteran was killed by two men using meat cleavers and knives in Woolwich on Wednesday (local time). Rigby was a member of 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. Britain's Ministry of Defence said he joined the army in 2006, and was posted in Cyprus, Afghanistan and Germany before becoming a recruiter, assisting with duties in the Tower of London. Captain Alan Williamson, the adjutant of the 2nd Fusiliers, calls Rigby "a cheeky and humorous man, always there with a joke to brighten the mood." He says the loss of Rigby "will be felt across the battalion, but this is nothing compared to how his family must be feeling." Rigby had a 2-year-old son, Jack. Meanwhile, it's emerged the two British men of Nigerian descent accused of killing him - in revenge for wars in Muslim countries - were known to security services. One man, filmed calmly justifying the killing as he stood by the body holding a knife and meat cleaver in bloodied hands, was named by acquaintances as 28-year-old Londoner Michael Adebolajo - a British-born convert to radical Islam. So frenzied was the attack, some witnesses thought they were trying to behead and disembowel the victim. The attack, just a month after the Boston Marathon bombing and the first Islamist killing in Britain since local suicide bombers killed 52 people in London in 2005, revived fears of "lone wolves" who may have had no direct contact with al Qaeda. British media said police raided homes of relatives in the city and near the town of Lincoln. Adebolajo and the other man, who may have been born abroad and later naturalised as British, are both in custody in hospitals after being shot by police. Prime Minister David Cameron held an emergency meeting of his intelligence chiefs to assess the response to what he called a "terrorist" attack it was the first deadly strike in mainland Britain since local Islamists killed dozens in London in 2005. "We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms," Cameron said outside his Downing Street office. "This was not just an attack on Britain and on the British way of life, it was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so much to our country. There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly dreadful act." He said there would be a review of how intelligence had been handled - Adebolajo had been known to authorities for handing out radical Islamist pamphlets in Woolwich. The two men had been considered to pose no serious danger to the public until the attack, according to a government source. Another source close to the inquiry said the local backgrounds of the suspects in a multicultural metropolis - nearly 40 per cent of Londoners were born abroad - and the simplicity of the attack made prevention difficult.</content>

		<title>Royal couple in 'hairy' helicopter ride</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/8712134/Royal-couple-in-hairy-helicopter-ride</link>
		<category>world/europe</category>
		<content>Britain's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, have been involved in a "hairy" emergency landing. The royal couple was flying by helicopter from London to Wales, where they were due to attend a literary festival. Fifteen minutes into the journey there was a technical problem, forcing the pilot to take action. The helicopter had to make an emergency landing at an aerodrome in Buckinghamshire, with all seven people on board brought to safety. "The pilot carried out a controlled emergency landing after diverting to the airport," a spokesman for the couple explained. A royal insider added: "It was quite a hairy experience." Charles, the heir to the throne, and Camilla were taken to a car and driven to their final destination. "The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were very determined to get to Hay and carry out their engagements as planned," their representative added. The pair looked relaxed and happy as they met with crowds at the literary event. Charles wore a simple grey suit, with Camilla opting for a pretty pale blue two-piece under a fawn mac. Fans turned out to meet the royal pair, with many astounded to hear what had just transpired. "They were unflappable despite what they went through," one person, who didn't want to be named, told British newspaper The Sun. "If anyone else had gone through what they did they would have cancelled their day." The reason for the emergency landing was being investigated.</content>

		<category>national</category>
		<content>Megan Fronings didn't order an extra topping on her cheese and mushroom pizza but got one anyway - a maggot. "I didn't believe it could have been a maggot but it was," she said. "It was disgusting. "It made me feel so sick that I had to vomit. It makes me wonder how many other maggots there were," she said. Miss Fronings, 19, took a picture of the maggot next to the discarded piece of pizza and her friend Sommer-Rose Steer posted the image to the Pizza Hut NZ Facebook page. "I was with her when she found it and I think it is disgusting. "It made me feel pretty sick just looking at it. You could tell it was a maggot because of the little black end on it," Miss Steer said. The photo received more than 320 likes and 140 comments, and resulted in a call from a Pizza Hut representative. "He offered to replace the pizza, but it would be better if they told us they were investigating and making sure there is nothing else in the store," Miss Fronings said. The pizza was purchased from Pizza Hut in central New Plymouth but when the Taranaki Daily News called about the incident, the manager declined to comment. Pizza Hut New Zealand released a statement last night and said they had reimbursed the customer for the cost of the $4.90 pizza. "Pizza Hut is taking this incident seriously," the statement said. The company wanted to collect the item in question but Miss Fronings said the maggot had already been washed down the sink. "If they had contacted us sooner, we would have kept it," she said. Because of that the company said they were "unable to determine exactly what the customer found in her pizza". The photo that was posted on Facebook would be used in an investigation. "We have provided a copy of the photograph to the supplier who provides the ingredients for our pizza toppings for their review and response," Pizza Hut said. Miss Fronings said she would not eat pizza for a while. "I don't even want to use the voucher," she said. "I just want them to make sure it doesn't happen again."</content>

		<title>Minister takes umbrage at MP's claims</title>

		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>Police Minister Anne Tolley says her Labour counterpart's comments on the force are nothing but desperate scare tactics. This week Kris Faafoi told the Taranaki Daily News public confidence in the police was dropping and said he was concerned about senior officers leaving the force around New Zealand. But Mrs Tolley said Labour should stop undermining the police and scaremongering. "The truth is, the facts don't suit them," she said. "Under Labour, crime was rising. Under National, it has fallen in each of the last three years, with recorded crimes down a total of 16.7 per cent and down 10.7 per cent last year in New Plymouth." She said last year there was a 70 per cent increase in foot patrols, and an extra 600 frontline police. "And let's not forget our investment in a brand new police station for New Plymouth which is currently under construction. "So there are now more cops, spending more time, in the right places preventing crime before it happens." She said things would improve even further when 6000 smartphones and tablets were rolled out to frontline officers. The rollout would result in an extra half a million frontline hours every year, as officers would not need to go back to stations to input and access data. "No wonder that public confidence in our police is at a record high, and I know New Zealanders will see through the desperate scare tactics from Labour." Mr Faafoi's comments came in the wake of revelations New Plymouth police have lost or are losing more than a dozen highly experienced staff. Departed former CIB boss Grant Coward has also taken a parting swipe, saying changes including budget cuts and new systems are eroding public confidence and frustrating officers. But Mrs Tolley said national attrition rates in the police force were extremely low.</content>

		<title>Dearth of tradesmen foreseen</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8711298/Dearth-of-tradesmen-foreseen</link>
		<category>business/industries</category>
		<content>The number of new trades trainees has dived over the past few years and some in construction are warning of a looming shortfall of skilled tradesmen. Tertiary Education Commission figures show the number of trades trainees enrolled with industry training organisations (ITOs) dropped 23 per cent nationally - from 165,224 to 126,978 - in the three years to 2011. Those figures have been mirrored in plummeting ITO enrolment figures and declining ITO revenue at Waikato's only technical institute, which is contracted to provide off-job training, pre-apprenticeship training and assessment. In Wintec's 2012 annual report a "marked decline" in equivalent fulltime ITO students was identified from a peak of 1019 in 2008 to 586 last year - a 32 per cent drop. Wintec chief executive Mark Flowers said that was largely attributable to the recession and reflected that some industries were not taking on the same number of trainees as they were five years ago. "ITO numbers in 2008 were at record high levels partly due to the housing boom. So if you look historically, the numbers are still quite reasonable." However, some in the sector have pointed out possibly dire outcomes from successive years of dropping numbers. Gayelene Woodcock, office administrator at Waikato Plumbing Services, said she believed the country would see an extreme shortage in qualified tradesmen in the next few years. "During the early 1990s the same thing happened. When there was a decline after the 1987 crash it didn't actually affect the whole industry until the early 1990s. "The lack of apprentices taken on there showed through about four or five years later when there was an extreme shortage of tradesmen." Early this year the Government outlined plans to boost the number of people in apprenticeships, increasing subsidies by about $12 million from 2014 and offering the first 10,000 new apprentices and their employers who enrolled after April 1 this year money towards tools and off-job course costs. But for some, it is too little, too late. "We have a shortage now in skilled tradesmen. It's welcome that the Government worked out they need to do something but the impact of that skilled shortage is being seen at the moment," said Grant Robertson, Labour deputy leader and spokesperson for employment, skills and training. "It's being seen in Christchurch and it's likely to be seen around the country." Fletcher Waikato region manager Mark Ritchie said it was recognised a while ago that the shortage was a major issue for the industry, but several initiatives were being undertaken to try to address it. "It is still an issue for industry, and it's quite an expense paying for apprenticeships, but you'll find most of the bigger players have continued with their regular numbers. "A lot of the apprenticeship numbers that tend to dwindle are related to the residential side rather than the commercial sector." Paul Hollings, head of specialist trades at New Zealand's plumbing ITO, The Skills Organisation, said that while the recession might have led to prudence among employers, the Government initiatives would improve trainee numbers.</content>

		<title>Tainui parliament could roll Rau</title>
		<description>A stoush is brewing among Tainui's political elite and will reach its peak this weekend when the tribal parliament decides whether to sack deputy chairman Hemi Rau.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8711236/Tainui-parliament-could-roll-Rau</link>
		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>understands they would need a whopping 75 per cent to take his executive spot. Te Riu o Waikato general manager Ricky Maipi complained to Te Kauhanganui after a "casual conversation" with Mr Rau allegedly turned to insult earlier in the year. "Inappropriate behaviour is inappropriate behaviour wherever you are," Mr Maipi said. "I took a formal complaint up with the tribe and of course I did write another letter to the Kauhanganui." The chairman of the executive apologised on behalf of the member and Mr Maipi held no grudge over the incident but had not received an apology from Mr Rau, he said. "I am prepared to overlook this incident but it doesn't negate the fact that it is going to be taken up by the Kauhanganui. "Tainui, as a group, cannot afford to lose people that certainly have a skill that they can bring for the further development of the tribe." Mr Rau was alleged to have acted dishonourably towards staff at the Waikato Raupatu Lands Trust and Waikato Raupatu River Trust. It is not the first scrape Mr Rau has had with his executive colleagues. In 2010 Mr Rau was sacked from the executive board after he was found to have leaked information to the media. Last November the Maori king, Tuheitia, criticised executive members including Tom Roa and Hemi Rau. Mr Rau declined to comment.</content>

		<title>100% Pure complaint 100% rejected</title>
		<description>Questioning the 100% Pure campaign is like questioning the Absolutely Positively Wellington brand or the I'm Lovin' It slogan of McDonald's, Tourism New Zealand says.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8711131/100-Pure-complaint-100-rejected</link>
		<category>business/industries</category>
		<content>Questioning the 100% Pure campaign is like questioning the Absolutely Positively Wellington brand or the I'm Lovin' It slogan of McDonald's, Tourism New Zealand says. The national tourism agency has successfully defended a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority laid by Fiji-based sustainable transport researcher Peter Nuttall, which was not upheld. Nuttall laid the complaint in March and said New Zealand could be the most pristine environment in the world. "But it ain't. Instead, we are saddled with short-term, narrow-focused profit-driven free marketeers more interested in spin-doctoring a myth to the world," he said. His complaint was backed by controversial freshwater scientist Mike Joy, who made headlines in November when he questioned the integrity of 100% Pure. At the time Tourism Minister John Key defended the brand saying, "It's like saying 'McDonald's, I'm Lovin' It' - I'm not sure every moment that someone's eating McDonald's, they're loving it ... it's the same thing with 100% Pure." The agency is no stranger to defending the successful, long-running global tourism marketing campaign which has been periodically attacked from various quarters over its 14-year run. Yesterday, Joy said the complaint had always been a "long-shot" and had been used to highlight the "fact that we're not 100 per cent pure". The authority disagreed with Nuttall's interpretation that the 100% Pure brand was "inextricably bound to environmental factors", instead finding 100% Pure "was a positioning statement" used "to promote the unique experiences New Zealand offered international tourists rather than an absolute claim about New Zealand's environmental purity". Tourism NZ spokeswoman Deborah Gray said the agency was never concerned about the complaint but was pleased by the outcome. "There is no environmental claim made by the 100% Pure New Zealand campaign, meaning there was never any basis to this complaint," she said. "Through the ongoing use of the highly successful 100% Pure New Zealand campaign, we will continue to deliver economic benefit to all of New Zealand."</content>

		<category>business/industries</category>
		<content>Kiwirail's safety practices have been criticised by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission after a series of blunders that nearly cost two Wellington track workers their lives. A report published yesterday reveals that a worker on drugs, haphazard training and incomplete paperwork were all factors in the near-collision. On the morning of August 25, 2011, three trains were waved through an active work site near Paekakariki without checks on whether staff were on the tracks. The third southbound train almost ran over two workers repairing the track, who leapt to safety just seconds before it hurtled past. The commission report shows the "protection" worker responsible for checking whether the track was clear had cannabis in his system at the time. It also shows that while he was watching the track, he received - and in some instances responded to - 50 text messages and five phone calls from his girlfriend. During the morning, he was asked three times whether the track was clear of workers for an approaching train. On each occasion, despite not being able to see the workers and making no attempt to contact them, he said the track was clear. "The fact that the protection person answered those radio calls but then did not complete the required checks would suggest that his focus was not really on the job, but elsewhere for some reason," the report says. KiwiRail confirmed yesterday that the worker had been sacked after the incident. But although the report found the worker's lapse was the "final act" that led to the near miss, it was only one of a series of mistakes. None of the workers involved, including the two who narrowly escaped, reported the incident. It was uncovered only when the train driver reported it on reaching Wellington station. The report also finds the plan for communicating on site was "inherently flawed" and should have been quickly fixed after the first two trains passed through the active work site. Half the group working on the track were trainees and it was not clear whether their supervisor, or "gang tracker", was adequately trained. In fact, KiwiRail's records were in such "disarray" that it was difficult to determine what training any worker had received, the report says. "Numerous records were not available or had been lost ... this was true for the entire country - not just for Wellington-based staff." Paperwork for the repairs on the day was signed off despite being submitted late and with errors. The commission recommended KiwiRail improved its safety and training systems and adopt a "zero-tolerance" approached to drugs and alcohol use.</content>

		<title>Man jailed for wife's murder</title>
		<description>A Tauranga man has been jailed for at least 11 years for stabbing his former wife to death while she sat in her car reading her mail, three months after she took out a restraining order against him.</description>

		<content>. The 57-year-old primary school teacher was found dead in the driveway of her Bell Street home in Tauranga on July 20, 2012. The estranged couple met in 2007 and were married in 2010. Their marriage began to break down and they separated following a domestic incident in April last year. Prole then took a restraining order out against her husband, three months before she was killed. Post-mortem results revealed she died from stab wounds sustained during what was described by Justice Kit Toogood as an unprovoked and brutal attack. "She sustained 11 stab wounds, some of them defensive wounds. "The attack was said Justice Toogood. Prole had gone to collect the mail from her Judea home on the afternoon of July 20 when Prole attacked her in the driveway. You saw Mrs Prole arrive to get the mail and took a kitchen knife and hid it in your pants. You walked down the 30 metre driveway and confronted her," said Justice Toogood. Prole reached through the open window of the driver side door and stabbed his wife in the hand, face and chest while she screamed she loved him. "She tried to move away but you pulled her close to you and continued to attack her,'' Justice Toogood said. You removed the keys from the ignition preventing any escape. Mrs Prole managed to get out of the vehicle but died a few metres from her car from the wounds she sustained." In sentencing today the court heard how Prole has a history of domestic violence offences with five prior convictions for threatening to kill, male assaults female and breaching protection orders. In 1993, the convicted murderer suffered a head injury as a result of a motorbike accident and psychiatrists believe he has the onset of early dementia. Justice Toogood said despite this, all three psychiatrists agreed Prole was mentally fit to plead. "Your offending was premeditated and you had the intention of doing harm. Your estranged wife suffered a prolonged attack and had defensive wounds on her arms and hands.</content>

		<title>'Racist' cartoon slammed</title>

		<category>national</category>
		<content>Prime Minister John Key has urged critics of cartoons about the the Government's breakfast in schools programme to accept cartoonists can blow things out of proportion. While he had not seen the cartoons, Key said he had heard second hand reports about them and understood they may not be to everyone's taste. "By the description I was given it certainly could be offensive to people." As a general rule, however, he tried not to comment too much on cartoons. "I'm often the source of the humour in them, if you like, and I try and take it all with a grain of salt because cartoonists are notorious for taking a mile out of an inch." His comments came after Race Relations Commissioner Susan Devoy said the cartoons were offensive and appalling. Her distaste for them has spurred her to question the high threshold required for a finding of racism within the commission's inquiries and complaints process. The threshold under the law was "very high" and was about inciting racial disharmony. "Perhaps it is not right that the threshold is that high," but that was a matter for the Government she said. Asked why anyone should make a complaint about the cartoons when the threshold for what was considered racism was so high, she replied: "I ask myself that all the time". Despite that, the Human Rights Commission could still address the issue, and she encouraged people to complain to the commission, the editors of the newspapers, and the Press Council. The cartoons, by award-winning cartoonist Al Nisbet, were printed in the Marlborough Express yesterday and The Press today. The Marlborough Express cartoon featured a group of adults dressed in school uniforms heading to school with bowls in hands. Among them were a man and woman who looked to be Maori or Pasifika. The man says to the woman, who has a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, "Psst. If we can get away with this, the more cash left for booze, smokes and pokies". The Press cartoon featured what appeared to be a rotund group of seven, surrounded by Lotto tickets, beer cans and cigarette packets. The man says: "Free school food is great. Eases our poverty and puts something in you kids' bellies." Devoy told reporters today the cartoons were a case of wrongful stereotyping. "It continues to stereotype certain populations, and it continues to stigmatise people who live in poverty, particularly children," she said. The cartoons were stereotyping Polynesian people as spending their money on cigarettes and gambling. "... that is wrong. Some of those families will, also will some Pakeha families ... It continues to perpetuate that myth," Devoy said. "... some parents living in poverty do their very, very, very best to feed their children, and probably don't even rely on food in schools and other things." Devoy said the editors of the newspapers should apologise for running the cartoons.</content>

		<title>Biggest RBNZ intervention in 5 years</title>
		<description>The Reserve Bank sold $256 million in April in an attempt to weaken the currency, the biggest monthly intervention since May 2008.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8735081/Biggest-RBNZ-intervention-in-5-years</link>
		<category>business/industries</category>
		<content>The bank buys and sells currency frequently, only disclosing the net position at the end of the following month. While Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler took the unusual step of confirming the bank was intervening in the markets to try to weaken the currency this month, today's figure is not one of the largest on record. In July 2007 the bank sold almost $1.5 billion, having sold $736m the previous month. Between February and May 2008, the bank sold more than $1.5b. But in a speech in Auckland this morning, Wheeler made it clear that commenting on the intervention sent a signal to the markets that the kiwi dollar was not a one-way bet. This month was the only time since mid-2007 that the central bank admitted that it was intervening to try to affect the currency. Speaking in Timaru today, Prime Minister John Key said he supported the Reserve Bank taking action which was ''appropriate and necessary'', but he still did not believe it would have much of an impact. ''I'm not a great fan of intervention because my own view is it doesn't work very effectively. Certainly that's been the international experience. ''But there are times when the Reserve Bank has intervened and in fact recently they declared they had and that looks like its had a little bit of success,'' said a former top currency trader. As ''a mechanism to go against the trend'' he did not believe it would be successful, but the Reserve Bank was independent and he backed Wheeler. ''He's an international expert, I rate him very highly, he knows what he's doing. If he goes down that path we will back him in that. But as a technique, as a general rule, I haven't seen a lot of evidence that it works.'' Finance Minister Bill English said the Reserve Bank had powers to try to take the top off exchange rate movements, but the Government did not believe it was worth taking major risks to try to lower the currency. ''We've made it pretty clear we don't believe it's worth taxpayers taking substantial risks around trying to manage the exchange rate,'' English said. No discussions had taken place with the bank about its intervention strategy, but English expected to be kept informed if it was done on a scale that could hurt the Crown's balance sheet.</content>

		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>A suspected meth dealer's attempt to flush away a zip-lock bag of P was foiled when a set of electronic scales jammed the loo en route to the sewerage system. Hamilton City tactical coordinator, Senior Sergeant Freda Grace, said armed officers helped carry out a search of the Fairfield property yesterday. "I understand he was trying to get rid of the scales, that he was using for weighing the methamphetamine, down the toilet," she said. "It was a very small set of scales." She said police suspect the man may have successfully flushed some product down the toilet before they got inside the house, but the 32-year-old offender failed to destroy "a large quantity" of suspected methamphetamine due to the blockage. Grace said a sizeable amount of cash and two imitation firearms were also recovered resulting in the man being charged with possession of methamphetamine for supply and breach of bail charges. He was due to appear in the Hamilton District Court today. "Yesterday's results highlight the need for police and the public to be vigilant and work together to combat the threat posed by drugs to our community," Grace said. She urged anyone with information or concerns around people with drugs to contact Police on 07 858 6200 or, alternatively, the Crimestoppers line to leave information anonymously on 0800 555111.</content>

		<title>NZRU negotiating Japan test for ABs</title>

		<category>sport/rugby</category>
		<content>The New Zealand Rugby Union have confirmed they are negotiating a test between the All Blacks and Japan in Tokyo en route to their November tour of Europe. After Japanese sports Sankei had initially reported that a November 2 test between the All Blacks and the Eddie Jones-coached Japan national team was set to be confirmed any day now, the NZRU confirmed that discussions around the proposed fixture were ongoing. "New Zealand Rugby and All Blacks management have been considering the value of another test this year as part of a much wider strategy focusing on the team's development heading towards 2015," chief executive Steve Tew said today. "As a result we have been exploring an option with the Japan Rugby Football Union for the All Blacks selected for the European tour to play Japan en route to Europe. "There is nothing to confirm at this stage and discussions are continuing." The All Blacks have never played an official test against Japan in Japan with the two nations having met only twice before, both at World Cups. The New Zealanders thumped the Cherry Blossoms 83-7 in Hamilton in 2011 and broke a host of records in a 145-17 shellacking at the 1995 tournament in South Africa. In 1987 John Hart took an All Blacks team to Japan but the internationals were not afforded full test In fact the fixture, if it goes ahead, would mark just the third time All Blacks history that they have played a side outside the big 10 of world rugby in an away The last occasion was in 1981 when they played Romania in Bucharest. But Tew denied the match was being looked at as a revenue generator, which has been the principal motivation for add-on tests in recent "If we reach agreement, we see this as a very positive opportunity for the younger players in the squad as the All Blacks build for the future," said Tew. "This is driven entirely by rugby reasons to meet the development needs of the This is also quite different from an extra European test. We are very mindful of the burdens on players. "We made it clear earlier this year that we did not want to put the All Blacks under the pressure of an additional European test so nothing changes in that regard." The All Blacks have previously played tests against the Wallabies in Hong Kong and Tokyo en route to their northern hemisphere November tours.</content>

		<content>. "It was an accident," Mr Bundesen said. "We thought it would get some laughs, with the Internet liking cats. And it just kept going." There's no doubting Grumpy Cat's star power: On top of that Grumpy Cat was voted Meme of the Year Award at the 2013 Webby Awards, named most influential cat of 2012 by MSNBC, has appeared on news shows and in magazines around the world and made a small fortune from merchandising deals. Not that Grumpy Cat cares. The 13-month-old mixed breed whose cranky facial expression is due to feline dwarfism remains unimpressed. Perhaps Grumpy Cat knows the Garfield movies bombed at the box office and that Garner is repsonsible for the Adam Sandler turkey Jack and Jill.</content>

"When found out they had edited the way her body really looked, she hit the roof," a source told British newspaper The Sun. "She's a true diva and was furious that she had been given such a snubbing. Her people refused to give the pictures the green light so M were forced to use the originals." An M spokesperson confessed there were "discussions" about the images.

		<title>Banks pleads not guilty in private prosecution</title>
		<description>ACT leader John Banks pleaded not guilty this morning in a private prosecution over political donations.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8734888/Banks-pleads-not-guilty-in-private-prosecution</link>
		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>ACT leader John Banks pleaded not guilty this morning in a private prosecution over political donations. Banks appeared in the Auckland District Court where his lawyer, David Jones QC, said the prosecution, brought by retired accountant Graham McCready, was "fundamentally flawed and so the charge will be defended". Banks faces a charge of filing a false electoral return after his failed 2010 bid for Auckland super city mayoralty. The case will be heard again in July and Banks will not be required to be present. In court today, McCready challenged Banks' defence counsel, claiming he was "statutorily barred" from representing Banks in court and he "questioned his conduct". When questioned by Judge Ema Aitken, McCready revealed he had laid a complaint over a claim Jones called him a "convicted criminal". McCready also said Jones said he was free to travel to Auckland, when he wasn't. Although a complaint had been laid with the NZ Law Society, Judge Aitken said it was a " long bow to stretch" and Jones was entitled to represent his client today. Outside court, Banks said he was defending the charge because "this is a process". "It's not the end but the end is in sight," he said. After first appearing in court on May 8, Banks said outside he had not committed any offence. He said he took the allegations against him seriously, as his appearance at court proved. "No-one is against [sic] the law," he said. "I will defend the charge because I haven't committed any offence." He added that he was "not fearful of any of this". The unusual prosecution was brought by McCready who also made several applications in Wellington in December, including disclosure of an electoral document and disclosure from police. Banks challenged the validity of the summons. When the case was first called at the Wellington District Court in December, Judge Jill Moss told McCready the court had no jurisdiction to hear anything about disclosure of information by police, and he would have to go to the ombudsman over Official Information Act requests. She pointed out he had been sent letter telling him that. However, Judge Moss was not willing to withdraw the information against Banks. The application was first laid in Auckland, which is why Banks was summoned to appear there. Court documents show Banks was charged that on or about December 9, 2010 he knowingly filed a false return for the Auckland 2010 Super City election.</content>

These Rotorua pals have become so close that if Curry, (that's the horse), loses sight of Wilber he nervously paces his paddock until his porcine pal Wilber the pig moved in two months ago when he was found as a piglet after his mother was "They haven't left each other's side since," said owner Dahna Fleming. Wilber also gets drafted in to help out with Curry's stubborn nature. Fleming said that whenever she can't get Curry to follow her she gets Wilber, who is easily lured by the promise of a scratch, to follow, and that this prompts Curry to join the procession.</content>

		<title>House consents hit five-year high</title>
		<description>A 43-per cent jump in building consents last month compared with the previous April was well above economists' forecasts.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8735961/House-consents-hit-five-year-high</link>
		<category>business/industries</category>
		<content>A 43-per cent jump in building consents last month compared with the previous April was well above economists' forecasts. Approval for 1755 houses and apartments was issued, the highest monthly number for five years, Statistics New Zealand said. A quarter of the consents were for Auckland, and Shamubeel Eaqub, of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research, said it appeared builders were starting to respond to Auckland's housing needs. "We're not far away from where they were in 2007, [but] we're still a long way back from where it was in the early 2000s, and certainly we need to keep building new homes to make up for the pause we had during the recession," Eaqub said. This could lead to the Auckland house price bubble bursting, with economic implications for the whole country, NZIER said. Economists said the jump in consents, up a seasonally adjusted 19 per cent compared with March, was affected by the volatile apartment market and by the timing of Easter. Westpac economist Michael Gordon was expecting a 13 per cent increase, although the figures were "probably understated for March and overstated for April". Nevertheless, "we estimate that the underlying trend is up". Non-residential building consents also strengthened last month, totalling $308 million. They were down from $364m in March but up 35 per cent on a year ago. March's figures were boosted by two large prison contracts worth $101m, which meant the picture of underlying non-residential activity looked more positive, Infometrics economist Gareth Kiernan said. Good regional growth had been recorded over the past two months in Auckland (up 56 per cent from 2012), Wellington (up 39 per cent) and Nelson (up 277 per cent), but the work in Canterbury was still only slightly higher than levels through the second half of last year. Given that Canterbury's work had yet to occur, however, he took the data to mean that the "patchy" growth of non-residential building work was becoming more broadbased. Building consents compared with April last year: â�� Wellington up 159 to 238 (including 82 city apartments and 63 retirement village units on the Kapiti Coast).</content>

		<title>Last Ocean sanctuary bid floundering</title>

		<category>environment</category>
		<content>New Zealand's diplomatic bid to create the world's largest marine sanctuary in the Ross Sea is floundering in its Antarctic waters after China and Japan stridently opposed it. Japan made it clear they don't even want discussion on the 4.9 million square kilometre marine protected area (MPA) which is backed by US Secretary of State John Kerry. The Ross Sea or "Last Ocean" plan went before last year's Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) but failed for lack of a consensus and decision making was moved to a meeting to be held in Bremerhaven, Germany, from July 11 to 16. A near fatal blow to the plan was delivered this week in Brussels at a meeting of the obscure Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) - a technical gathering of 450 delegates from 50 parties including New Zealand. Its final out yesterday makes no mention of the MPA but an account of mostly closed door discussion was issued by the Washington NGO, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition. proposed a motion to support CCAMLR's process on creating the MPA and this was backed by Prince Albert of Monaco who at the opening called for the creation not just of the Ross Sea MPA, but also one in East Antarctica which is proposed by Australia, the European Union and France. The Coalition said that Belgium's resolution to support the MPA process "gained widespread support, but was shot down at the end by China and Japan." already refuses to recognise the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. According to the Coalition, Japan even objected to the ATCM expressing any kind of support for the work of CCAMLR and did not want reference to it in the final report. The coalition's executive director, James Barnes, said the German meeting was the first ever special CCAMLR meeting and all sides were working intensively on the plans. But he said this week's development "was a worrying harbinger". Foreign Minister Murray McCully, who is pushing the Ross Sea plan, was unavailable for immediate comment. Controversially the Ross Sea MPA as drafted by Wellington and Washington will allow for some catching of Antarctic toothfish, one of the world's most lucrative catches. The ATCM also held a special session on search and rescue in the Southern Ocean in the wake of the sinking earlier this year of the Chinese krill boat Kai Xin off the Antarctic Peninsula and the sinkings in the Ross Sea of the Korean boats Insung 1 (with the loss of 22 crew) and Jeong Woo in which three died. Four people were killed when the yacht Berserk disappeared in a storm. ATCM called for improvements to fishing boat safety. A New Zealand paper presented at the meeting said statistically the quickest response to alarms in the Ross Sea would come from "vessels of opportunity". But even then ice and weather conditions made offering help difficult, point to the 2011 Berserk incident which was near the off shore patrol boat HMNZS Wellington but it could do nothing due to extreme weather conditions.</content>

		<title>$22m property frozen in fraud case</title>

		<category>business/farming</category>
		<content>A $5.5 million Auckland harbourside mansion is part of $22m worth of residential property assets that have been frozen under the fraud prosecution of former Crafar farms bidders May Wang and Jack Chen. Details of the assets were revealed after Fairfax Media sought court documents relating to the case, which has been conducted behind closed doors in Hong Kong. The property at 11 Cliff Rd in St Heliers Bay is owned by Anfatex Global Financial Investment Holdings, wholly owned by Chen, also known as Chen Keen. Anfatex owns two adjacent properties on Lammermoor Ave that are valued at a combined $7m but were bought by Anfatex for $8m in February 2010. Chen and wife Ye Fang also own a $5.3m property in Parnell, two in Howick valued at a combined $1.44m and another worth $500,000 in Flatbush - all of which have been frozen. Chen's BMW X5 has also been frozen and is, with the other assets, under the management of the Official Assignee. Another $1.7m property, at 35 Dudley Rd in Mission Bay, is subject to the asset freezing order through its ownership by Wu Rong, an interested party on the New Zealand freezing order. The Cliff Rd property is subject to a Kiwibank mortgage, while four ASB Bank accounts, four BNZ accounts and shareholdings in several New Zealand-registered companies have been frozen. Also subject to the freezing order is $9.5m worth of rural property near Palmerston North, collectively known as the Ashhurst block, which is owned by UBNZ Asset Holdings Ltd, with mortgages to ASAP Finance and NZ Dairy Trustee. The properties were bought by UBNZ in 2008 for $6.63m, including $37,000 worth of chattels. All three respondents - Wang, Chen and Fang - are opposing "registration" of the asset restraining order, which would formalise the interim order in place after a request from Hong Kong prosecutors. That opposition is due to be heard at the High Court in Auckland in July or August, but the restraining order continues until then. Wang and Chen are on bail awaiting trial in Hong Kong on charges that Wang conspired to offer two properties in Auckland and a sum of over HK$73m ($11.6m) to Chen as rewards for Chen to get Natural Dairy to acquire UBAH, a company owned by Wang. Under the arrangement, the pair acted as middlemen in a deal to try to buy the Crafar farms for Chinese interests, but Chen, Fang and several others also face charges of money laundering for procuring investment money from Chinese backers on false representations. Pre-trial proceedings in the Hong Kong prosecution are set to continue in September.</content>

		<title>Dunedin murderer 'on the run'</title>
		<description>A convicted murderer who has been evading police capture for five months, should not be approached, police say.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8736913/Dunedin-murderer-on-the-run</link>
		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>A convicted murderer who has been evading police capture for five months, should not be approached, police say. George Trounson, 41, who was released on parole, is wanted on an interim recall order to prison but police believe he is deliberately evading capture. Dunedin tactical co-ordinator Senior Sergeant Jason Guthrie said the best outcome would be for Trounson to hand himself in. "We would really like him to come forward, it would be the best thing for him to do." Trounson was jailed for life in 1991 after being found guilty of murdering Russell Neil in Dunedin. A 19-year-old student at the time, Trounson bashed Neil, 17, in the head with a large piece of wood broken from a staircase. This was Trounson's sixth recall application since he was first released in 2001. In the latest Parole Board decision in October last year regarding Trounson's liberty, an application to recall from Corrections was declined by the board, acknowledging that although he had made some errors in judgement he still had considerable support to help him reintegrate into the community. The decision came with a warning though. "In future Mr Trounson needs to be very mindful of how his actions will impact upon liberty in the future." But another request for interim recall was made in January, and Trounson has not been seen by authorities since then. It is not known why that request was made. Although his parole conditions dictate he should be in Christchurch, Guthrie said police had information to suggest he was in Dunedin, and may be getting around in a white ute. He said although there was no evidence to suggest Trounson would act violently to members of the public, he had had violence issues in the past and it was common sense not to approach him. Police said Trounson was of solid build, and about 177cm tall. He had fish scales tattooed on the back of his left hand and the word "love" tattooed on his right fingers. Anyone with information on his whereabouts should call Dunedin Police on (03) 471 or the anonymous Crimestoppers line 0800 555 111.</content>

		<category>sport/rugby</category>
		<content>There is no chance of Richie McCaw making a surprise appearance for the Crusaders against the Waratahs tomorrow night. McCaw made a rare appearance at a Crusaders training this morning but his activities t extend beyond standing on the sidelines and speaking to the s management staff and several young fans at AMI Stadium. Crusaders head coach Todd Blackadder dismissed the chance of any wild rumours getting started, stating the Waratahs have nothing to worry about ahead of tomorrow s match in Christchurch. McCaw, who is on a from rugby duties until early July, is still putting his rugby career on ice. I think he was just down here to see the doctor and that was about Blackadder said. The s visit was fleeting. He disappeared by the time the majority of the media contingent arrived and did no interviews. There is still no definitive answer on whether McCaw will play for the franchise this year and Blackadder said any decision as to whether the openside flanker would add to his 120 Super Rugby cans will be made by the All Blacks captain himself. We are not really sure. All the chats have just been jovial, friendly stuff. We t really talked about his return. When he is ready he will tell Since embarking on his New Zealand Rugby Union-sanctioned holiday there have been few sightings of McCaw at Crusaders trainings. During his free time he has been busy travelling to countries such as the United States, flying and doing promotional work for Fonterra in Sri Lanka. McCaw has recently begun training - on his own - and Blackadder noted he might have a few extra unwanted kilos to shed before he strikes his perfect playing weight. He is huffing and puffing when he is doing some work in the gym. I think he has had a true sabbatical, he has taken time away and will spend the next month or so getting fit. There is no way he would be ready to play rugby at the moment, or even in the next three to four weeks. We will just wait and see like everyone else. He will tell us and then we will make sure we have a plan and introduce him back if he wants</content>

		<content>accepted his behaviour was inappropriate and went against police values. Police had started an employment investigation after the acquittal, which would now be halted because of his resignation. Bradley denied the charge brought against him of corruption and bribery of a law enforcement officer. Gibson reaffirmed his praise to the woman who spoke up about his conduct. "This woman has gone through some very difficult and emotionally testing times but through this whole process she has acted with integrity and strength," he said. Gibson said Bradley's actions were not a reflection of the whole police force.</content>

		<title>Employer tattoo coverup request ruled OK</title>
		<description>A spit roast catering company has been awarded $15,000 in costs against the Director of Human Rights Proceedings after winning the right to ask an employee to cover up her tattoos.</description>

		<content>to refuse to hire a woman due to a visible ta moko, or traditional Maori tattoo. In May 2010 Haupini, a Spit Roast Catering Company casual employee, was asked to cover up a tattoo on her forearm while catering a corporate function. Spit Roast Catering Company owner Graham Peet said Haupini did not communicate at the time that she had an issue with the request. She later approached the Human Rights Commission and attempts were made to settle the case out of court. Peet said that in April 2011 the company offered Haupini a $3000 settlement and an apology, which was rejected. However, in October 2011, the tribunal agreed that there was a rational business-related reason for the company's request. Peet said the $15,000 in costs the tribunal had now awarded the company were nothing like the $60,000 it has cost to fight the matter. The company had sought more than $40,000 in costs. Peet said the case had nothing to do with cultural respect and everything to do with a company wanting to be professional. There was a harmonious atmosphere at the company, with a lot of staff being employed for many years, he said. He added that Haupini should have approached her manager first if she had a problem. Peet said few people or companies were awarded costs against the Office of Human Rights Proceedings which operates separately to the Human Rights Commission. The decision comes at a time when corporate policy around visible tattoos is in the spotlight. In January Claire Nathan applied for a cabin crew position with Air New Zealand and an interview was terminated last month due to the tattoo on her forearm. Air New Zealand said it was reviewing the policy which was about making customers feel comfortable. It said many passengers came from cultures where tattoos were considered to be frightening or intimidating, so the airline had a no-visible-tattoo policy.</content>

		<title>Doh Canada! Beauty pageant farce</title>
		<description>For 24 hours, Denise Garrido's dreams had come true.</description>

		<content>after the title, the crown and the sash were stripped from her. Garrido, from Bradford, Ontario, was a biomedical sciences graduate who had a black belt in TaeKwon-Do. Also under her belt were titles for the 2008 Miss Earth Canada and the 2010 Miss World Canada pageants. In spite of the mortifying mistake, she did not hold any animosity towards the organisation. It all came down to a "typo", the pageant director, Denis Davila said. Somebody hit the wrong key while inputting the judges' scores into a computer, which went on to work out the winner, The Star reported. The real winner? Riza Santos, a 26-year-old from Calgary, Alberta, who has studied engineering and had previously served in the armed forces when she was a teenager. By the time the mistake was revealed Santos had flown home, but she had since been reunited with her crown. On the Beauties of Canada website in the lead up to the competition, Santos gushed about what the title meant to her. "Becoming the next Miss Universe Canada means much more than merely winning a crown. "It would give me the opportunity to serve my country and empower women to achieve their dreams. Not everyone aspires to be a beauty queen, but everyone deserves to achieve their dream." Santos will go on to represent her country at the Miss Universe Competition in the United States in December. Even though she reigned for a day all Garrido will be able to do is continue to dream, until next year. The competition is not new to controversy after its decision last year to ban a transgender competitor. Jenna Talackova, then 23, competed with 61 contestants and was among the final 12 contestants. The Vancouver, British Columbia, native was initially denied entry to the pageant because she was not a natural-born female. After a global outcry and a petition signed by more than 20,000 people Donald Trump, who runs the Miss Universe Organisation, overruled the</content>

		<title>Crying baby put in freezer</title>
		<description>Bail was set at US$1 million for a 25-year-old Washington state man who is accused of putting his 6-week-old daughter in a freezer for about an hour to stop her crying.</description>

		<category>world/americas</category>
		<content>Bail was set at US$1 million for a 25-year-old Washington state man who is accused of putting his 6-week-old daughter in a freezer for about an hour to stop her crying. Doctors believe the baby will survive, but it's too soon to know potential complications, Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said. The child's core temperature fell to 28.8 degrees Celsius in the freezer, prosecutors said. She also had a broken arm and leg and a head injury, medical staff determined. Tyler James Deutsch pleaded not guilty to charges of child assault, criminal mistreatment and interfering with the reporting of domestic violence. He was represented by a public defender. According to court papers, Deutsch gave Pierce County sheriff's officers several accounts, but finally said he put the child in the freezer Saturday afternoon "because he was tired and she was crying". Deutsch said he fell asleep, awoke as the baby's 22-year-old mother returned to their trailer in Roy, Washington, and was removing the baby from the freezer as the mother came in, according to the prosecutor's account. Deutsch said little at Tuesday's arraignment (NZT Wednesday) other than to answer "yes" to Pierce County Court Commissioner Meagan Foley's questions about his address and the spelling of his name, The News Tribune reported. The baby was clothed when the mother left, court documents said, but wore only a diaper when she was removed from the freezer. The man was accused of taking a phone away when the mother tried to call for help. She took the child and got neighbours to call 911, authorities said. Foley set a tentative trial date of July 15. If the man makes bail he'll be barred from any contact with the baby or her mother.</content>

The Fire Service attended a Plymouth St blaze yesterday, which destroyed a house and saw minimal damage inflicted on a neighbouring house. Fireman Gary Wilson said when they arrive residents told them everyone had escaped safely except for a puppy, which was still inside. "We did a search and found the puppy, I picked it up and we actually thought it was dead, but then it moved slightly so I breathed into it's mouth and then we got it on some oxygen." Wilson said a veterinary clinic was not too far down the road so the puppy was able to be treated straight away. "The vet said the puppy should be OK, they were just going to keep it in overnight to keep an eye on it." Wilson said he did not know the puppy's name but it was very young "only about a foot long". The fire was thought to have been started by sparking electrical cord in the bedroom.</content>

		<content>Intermediate staff have been left fuming after a letter telling them they would close referenced the wrong school. Ministry of Education representatives visited Branston on Wednesday to inform staff href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/schools/7732110/Branston-Intermediate-School" target="_self">the school was to by the end of the year. However, Branston's staff were stunned when the ministry staff handed them a letter addressing the school as Linwood Intermediate. Reference was made to Branston Intermediate in the early part of the letter, but then switched to the wrong school in the last paragraph. It was signed by the Minister of Education Hekia Parata. ''I would like to take this opportunity to record my appreciation of the service that the board, its current and former members and the school staff have given to Linwood Intermediate School,'' it read. Principal Jennifer O'Leary was the first to notice the mistake.''They gave us all a copy and I was reading through and noticed it said the wrong school. I pointed it out to them and they looked pretty embarrassed,'' she said. O'Leary was ''pretty angry'' at the blunder. ''[Parata] didn't have to sign that many of them. Surely she could have read them more closely. But then the whole thing has been handled badly so it's par for the course, really'' Branston Intermediate music teacher Geoffrey McCallum said staff were ''highly disappointed'' by the error. ''It makes it seem like she didn't even bother to read the individual submissions. It was obviously just a generic letter and they hadn't changed the school name. It's a small thing but shows a lack of caring.'' The ministry staff took the letter away after the meeting and returned with a correct version a few hours later. ''They apologised profusely but it just shouldn't have happened,'' O'Leary said.</content>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv/8738737/All-screaming-for-all-singing-Cassie</link>
		<category>entertainment/tv</category>
		<content>Is it too early to call? Well, based on the reaction of the 300 screaming fans at a meet and greet with the X-Factor judges at Auckland's Sylvia Park mall tonight the other 10 contestants may as well go home because the public vote is well in the corner of 14-year-old Cassie Henderson. Not even a miserable wet night could stop these fans from coming out to meet their idols and they were even surprised with a guest appearance by four of the remaining 11 contestants including Henderson, Benny Tipene, Anna Wilson and Jackie Thomas. Tipene immediately got the crowd on side by saying "there's some pretty good looking people And he admitted that the adoration was all a bit new for him. "This never happens in Palmerston North." Controversial judge Daniel Bedingfield was not able to make the event but host Dominic Bowden Melanie Blatt, Stan Walker and Ruby Frost were all there to take questions from the crowd and to sign autographs. Earlier in the afternoon fans lining up were able to have a sing off. Acacia Harris, 19, who had not "got around" to auditioning for X-Factor won the sing off, and a CD, with a song that was last sung by her favourite contestants - girls group Gap5 - Lorde. Harris said judge was Blatt "because she's so straight up", but many others seemed to be all about Walker. The event was being filmed and will make up part of the next live show to screen on Sunday.</content>

		<title>Terminator-like killer robots worry UN</title>
		<description>Should robots be allowed to take a human life, without direct supervision or command?</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/8740534/Terminator-like-killer-robots-worry-UN</link>
		<category>technology</category>
		<content>Should robots be allowed to take a human life, without direct supervision or command? Science fiction met reality at the United Nations in Geneva overnight, where this question was debated at a meeting of the Human Rights Council. UN special rapporteur Christof Heyns told the council that countries are developing armed robots that can kill without the need for human choice or intervention, and they need to call a halt before it's too late. "The possible introduction of LARs (lethal autonomous robots) raises far-reaching concerns about the protection of life during war and peace," Mr Heyns said. "If this is done, machines and not humans, will take the decision on who is alive or dies." Mr Heyns presented a report on his research and called for a worldwide moratorium on the production and deployment of such machines, while nations figured out the knotty legal and ethical issues. "War without reflection is mechanical slaughter," he said. "In the same way that the taking of any human life deserves - as a minimum - some deliberation, a decision to allow machines to be deployed to kill human beings deserves a collective pause worldwide." Mr Heyns warned that if humans are taken "out of the loop" then it could make war more likely. It was also unclear how these killer robots could be programmed to distinguish the enemy from innocent civilians. And because they lacked the ability to act "out of compassion or grace" and understand the bigger picture, a robot would never decide that some specific situations required greater leniency, even in wartime. In his report, Mr Heyns said robots will be "the next major revolution in military affairs, on par with the introduction of gunpowder and nuclear bombs" Officially, governments who are capable of producing "Lethal Autonomous Robots" are not currently planning to use them. Some argue that, "as a matter of principle, robots should not be granted the power to decide who should live and die," the report said – though others say that, used well, they could "even make armed conflict more humane and save lives on all sides". Mr Heyns acknowledged that future generations of robots could be able to employ less lethal force, causing fewer unnecessary deaths, with their greater ability to immobilise or disarm a target. "LARs will not be susceptible to some of the human shortcomings that may undermine the protection of life," the report said. "Typically they would not act out of revenge, panic, anger, spite, prejudice or fear. "Robots also do not rape." During the debate Pakistan's council delegate – speaking on behalf of 56 Islamic states – said the international community should consider a complete ban, not just national moratoria. Lethal autonomous robots would fundamentally change the nature of war, she said. Pakistan has been the focus for anti-terrorism drone strikes. "The experience with drones shows that once such weapons are in use, it is impossible to stop them," she said.</content>

		<category>national</category>
		<content>A teenage agriculture student was meant to be ending two weeks' work on a dairy farm today as he prepared for a life farming. Instead, he is dead and his friend is in hospital after their car was found upside down beside a broken concrete power pole early yesterday. Tyler Swinbank, 17, a student at the Taratahi Agricultural Training Centre near Masterton, was killed in the crash on Kahutara Rd between Martinborough and Lake Wairarapa some time before 3am. The Nissan Bluebird in which he was a passenger skidded for about 120 metres, left the road and hit a fence before stopping upside down at the foot of the power pole. The 18-year-old driver was taken to Wellington Hospital in the Westpac rescue helicopter about 4am. He was in a stable condition last night. Police at the scene said it was too early to say what caused the crash, but it appeared speed and alcohol might have been factors. Blood samples will be analysed as part of their investigation. Tyler's grandfather, Keith Swinbank, of Shannon, said yesterday: "What Tyler's done last night is what too many of our 17- to 25-year-old boys do, isn't it? He's gone out hooning with his mate." Mr Swinbank and his wife raised Tyler, who had a sister and four brothers, after his father died when he was 5. "He was keen to follow in my footsteps in the dairy farming industry." Mr Swinbank said he would especially remember his grandson's dry sense of humour, which was "a bit like his dad's". Tyler's great-uncle, Tony Heyward, of Carterton, said Tyler had been living with him and his wife since about Easter, when he began studying at Taratahi. "He was a very popular young man. He loved his farming work and his time at Taratahi. He had a lot of potential and he'll be very sadly missed by all his family and his many mates." Mr Heyward said Tyler loved the bush, hunting, animals and "working on or driving any kind of machinery". He and the driver of the car had spent the past two weeks working on a dairy farm near Kahutara, and were due to finish today. "We just thought they were late for work, then this," the farm manager said. Another farmer living near the crash scene said he was woken by a "huge thud" about 3am. "Young fellas go too fast on this road all the time. It's not the first car to miss that bend. "I've often thought someone's going to come a cropper there." Taratahi chief executive Donovan Wearing said the centre's staff and students were devastated by the tragedy. "Our deepest sympathies go to the students' families and friends. "Every single one of our students is precious, so to lose one is heartbreaking."</content>

		<title>Erakovic stuns 16th seed at French Open</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/tennis/8740285/Erakovic-stuns-16th-seed-at-French-Open</link>
		<category>sport/tennis</category>
		<content>New Zealand's Marina Erakovic has notched one of her finest victories in a Grand Slam tennis event, progressing to the third round of the French Open for the first time in her career. The 25-year-old has upset former French Open semifinalist and this year's 16th seed, Dominika Cibulkova, 6-2 2-6 6-4 this morning (NZT) to reach the last 32 in a slam for just the second time, matching her best showing at Wimbledon in 2008. And she has to be considered a chance of exploring uncharted territory, given she's avoided the big names in the third round. Erakovic will play 20-year-old Sloane Stephens for a place in the fourth round the American is the tournament's 17th seed but Erakovic should be undaunted, particularly as the only previous meeting between the pair ended in a 4-6 6-0 6-1 win for the Kiwi on hard court at last year's Memphis WTA stop. Unlike her clinical 6-3 6-0 first round win over Brit Elena Baltacha, today's rain-interrupted victory was a strong mix of excellence and nerves. Erakovic had a match point at 5-2 in the deciding set and was then broken serving at 5-3, but at 30-all in the 10th game Erakovic picked the perfect time to unleash consecutive forehand winners to break the Slovakian's serve and close out at the match. It was a fitting way to end, given she'd had 38 winners to Cibulkova's 17 throughout the match, possibly the difference between the two otherwise evenly matched players. However, there will be areas for concern as the Kiwi prepares to face Stephens, such as a high unforced error count - 71 in all - and a first serve percentage of just 48, well down on her first round match. Erakovic made an excellent start, comfortably holding her own serve then breaking Cibulkova's. As the set progressed, the 16th seed started to come into the game, but Erakovic held on in a tough fourth game to take a 3-1 lead. In the seventh game Erakovic made three unforced errors which helped the Slovakian to get a break point but the New Zealander was able to get herself of trouble thanks to her big first serves. The second set started with a break of serve and then a hold for Cibulkova, but when it got to 3-2 in her favour rain started to fall and the players left the court. Over an hour and a half later play resumed and it took just 15 minutes for Cibulkova to clean up the set.</content>

		<title>Ex-clamper charged over guard work</title>
		<description>New Plymouth's out-of-action wheel-clamper has been charged with operating as an unlicensed property guard.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8739397/Ex-clamper-charged-over-guard-work</link>
		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>New Plymouth's out-of-action wheel-clamper has been charged with operating as an unlicensed property guard. Daniel Clout, 31, was appealing against an assault conviction in the High Court yesterday morning when his lawyer, Kylie Pascoe, revealed that charges had been laid against him. Following an investigation by the Department of Internal Affairs, Clout has been charged with operating as a property guard without a licence, which Ms Pascoe said he would be defending. The charges come on the back of about three years of escalating tension among the public, the police and Clout, who is not working and is on a benefit after giving up his job in March. During his tenure as New Plymouth's only wheel-clamper the Taranaki Daily News received complaints about Clout. In January he countered by releasing video footage of some of his interactions with people he had clamped. The footage showed an incident in which a woman beat him with her handbag and spat at him. Clout also came to media attention after clamping an unmarked police car last year and later said he had lodged 16 individual complaints with the Independent Police Conduct Authority alleging police were making it impossible to do his job. No decision on those complaints has been announced. Yesterday Clout was appealing against the assault conviction he received in the New Plymouth District Court when he was found guilty of punching a 20-year-old German tourist in the face after the two argued about the clamping of the tourist's van. At the time Clout admitted he had hit the tourist but claimed it was in self-defence because the tourist had pushed him. Yesterday Ms Pascoe told Justice Forrest Miller because the victim, whose evidence was given in a written form, was back in Germany he could not be cross-examined by the defence. Crown prosecutor Sarah Law said the tourist's statement largely matched the evidence given by two other Crown witnesses and being able to question him would not have made a difference to Clout's defence of self-defence. Clout is also appealing against his sentence and Ms Pascoe said he was seeking his conviction be discharged so he had a better chance of getting a property guard's licence should it be determined he needs one to work as a wheel-clamper. The judge requested further information from the defence and the Crown, and reserved his decision for a week.</content>

		<title>Will reality kill the vocal star?</title>
		<description>New Zealand On Air spent $1,600,000 in taxpayer funds to help Australian company Fremantle Media and Sony put a group of would-be stars and TV3's show The X Factor into our living rooms but some believe that such shows are actually harming young singers' voices and potentially killing our music culture.</description>

		<content>New Zealand On Air spent $1,600,000 in taxpayer funds to help Australian company Fremantle Media and Sony put a group of would-be stars and TV3's show The X Factor into our living rooms but some believe that such shows are actually harming young singers' voices and potentially killing our music culture. Auckland-based Cheryl McLeay, QSM CCM, is a respected vocal coach. She has worked with the likes of Grammy-winning Kimbra, Annie Crummer and Jason Kerrison - Opshop frontman and judge of New Zealand's Got Talent - among others. McLeay offers her students individual guidance in technique and craft, the kinetics of tone production and breath control, and is a specialist in laryngeal biomechanics. Her services have her in demand in Los Angeles, New York, Sydney and Cape Town. She believes judges on such reality shows lack the experience themselves to properly critique others. "A lot of advice they give out is rubbish," McLeay said. "Jason Kerrison is different, he is the only one I will name. He understands what is required, and has had the training and tuition to understand what damage the wrong song can do to an immature larynx." McLeay said that if a young competitor with an immature larynx was given the wrong song, it could cause them "great harm" and cause them to develop soft tissue swelling or nodules which could halt their careers before they had even begun. "A lot of these shows are doing damage to contestants. The coaches that a lot of these shows have backstage are performance coaches, not vocal coaches. They pick the song, do a bit of choreography, but if they give them the wrong song, then they're doing damage. I don't care about those shows but I do care about what is happening to these young singers." When critiquing contestants, judges often threw around phrases like "too pitchy" or "beautiful timbre" but McLeay said some judges did not really know what the phrases meant. "Many of these so-called judges know nothing. Having one or two hits doesn't make you an expert. "Usually when they use the word pitchy, they're just copying other people who have said it," McLeay said. "If someone is off key in the whole song, it means they don't have the muscle memory of creating a note. Whenever they sing off key in the odd note, usually in the bridge or chorus, normally in the middle to high note, it's because of palatal choice." Incorrect palate could create poor tonal quality which caused sharpness or could flatten a note. "They don't know the biological working of the larynx. Some of these judges don't know the different between the larynx and the throat." Many times it was not the larynx that was damaged, it was the throat and pharynx. McLeay was asked by The Press to provide comments on recent critiques by judges on The X Factor. She declined because she felt it was not fair on the judges who did not have her knowledge and said it also was not fair on the contestants who would get confusing messages.</content>

		<title>Abandoned schools could become crime spots</title>
		<description>Abandoned Christchurch schools will give struggling communities the "kiss of death" and become hotbeds of crime, a former Invercargill principal says.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/8739331/Abandoned-schools-could-become-crime-spots</link>
		<category>national/education</category>
		<content>Abandoned Christchurch schools will give struggling communities the "kiss of death" and become hotbeds of crime, a former Invercargill principal says. Christchurch police and communities losing schools to closures and mergers are concerned that the vacant buildings will attract petty crime and become eyesores. The Ministry of Education plans to sell all school sites left vacant by the overhaul and reinvest capital back into Christchurch's school network. They will all be shut by May 2014. However, it can take up to three years to sell a Crown property under the Public Works Act. The 15 sites have a combined rateable value of $51.8 million. Lessons can be drawn from Invercargill, which is still littered with vandalised, decaying schools after it underwent a similar overhaul in 2004. Alan Dennis, president of the Invercargill Licensing Trust, was the last principal of Tweedsmuir Junior High School, which closed under a raft of changes imposed by Labour education minister Trevor Mallard. The campus was absorbed into Southland Girls' High School. Dennis said many of the schools now stand vacant around the city. "They are an absolute eyesore. The Government just turned the key and walked away." The empty properties brought surrounding suburbs into decline, he said, and he would rather they had been torn down and replaced with parks and other community facilities. "Having a community with a dead school is tantamount to a kiss of death. The buildings are chronic - like having a decaying centre of the city. Years later we are looking at them and remembering the population decline and the urban decline." Linwood Intermediate principal Lee Walker said there were already worries about the future of the school's McLean St site when it closes in January. "We had a community meeting recently and our immediate neighbours did express concern about it," he said. "We hardly get any graffiti but there is concern that once we start to get a few broken windows then everything will go downhill." Sergeant Todd Webley, who heads the Phillipstown Neighbourhood policing team, said any building left abandoned was worrying. "We've just done a job in an abandoned house that somebody has gone through." His team would work to ensure the Phillipstown school site, on Nursery Rd, did not slip into decline after the merger with Woolston school. The Government could pocket more than $51 million if it sells all schools vacated by closures and mergers. The 15 sites that could be left vacant have a combined rateable value (land and buildings) of $51.8m, according to the most up-to-date statistics released in 2007.</content>

		<title>Low interest rates a 'trap'</title>

		<category>national</category>
		<content>Home buyers are being warned to look long-term as lenders offer record short-term mortgage rates. Fixed one-year interest rates have fallen below 5 per cent in the past week as house prices soar in the main centres. However, two mortgage brokers and a financial planner are cautioning borrowers tempted by short-term interest rates. Broker Gary Dobbs warned house hunters not to focus on low interest rates and budget on mortgage payments of 8 per cent. "Mortgage rates have been between 5 and 10 per cent in the last 10 years 8 per cent represents a rough average." Dobbs suggested borrowers have a plan, as he expected an interest rate hike to 8 per cent in the future. "Banks used to assess you on a higher interest rate but they don't anymore." Financial planner Stephen McFarlane said short-term low interest rates were a trap. "The banks are luring us in. What will the interest rate look like when our wonderful rate has expired and we still have many years of repayments ahead of us?" McFarlane said. He advised borrowers to mix floating with low short-term fixed rates, and target at least 50 per cent in three to five-year terms. "It will provide some risk management and some certainty at the risk of a stronger than expected rate McFarlane said. Broker Malcolm McDonald said the Official Cash Rate was predicted to rise by 100 to 125 points by the end of next year. "It would be better to look at the longer two to three-year terms which are all just as competitive," McDonald said. "If I was buying a house now I would base my personal budget around being able to pay a rate 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent higher than current rates. "Budgeting to pay more than the carded rate allows borrowers to take advantage of lower rates and assists in reducing debt." McDonald said there had always been three cardinal rules to borrowing - "Savings, serviceability and security." Will Walford, 30, and his partner Bronwyn own three homes. They were paying 10 per cent interest on the mortgage when they first bought in 2005. Both are working, without dependants, and could still service the mortgage if interest rates hit 10 per cent again. They are paying a floating rate on their own home and a fixed rate on their two rental properties. Two empty rentals and one income would be the worst case scenario, Walford says. "It would be tight if we only had one income." He said they did not expect low interest rates to last forever. "Interest rates have been under 6 per cent for at least two years so we are not maxing out what we can borrow. We are within the 80 to 20 borrowing ratio. "We have our own home on a flexible overdraft at 5.6 per cent and we treat that like a bank account so we can get it paid off as quickly as possible." Their rental properties are fixed at 4.99 per cent over two years. "If the mortgages go up the rents go up." Walford said they offered their rentals below the market rate. "It offered us a bigger choice in terms of tenant lower rent has given us a lot more tenants to pick from. We can use the rental income as a way to leverage interest rates."</content>

		<title>Sanctuary plans in deep water</title>
		<description>New Zealand's diplomatic bid to create the world's largest marine sanctuary in the Ross Sea is floundering after China and Japan stridently opposed it.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8739246/Sanctuary-plans-in-deep-water</link>
		<category>national</category>
		<content>New Zealand's diplomatic bid to create the world's largest marine sanctuary in the Ross Sea is floundering after China and Japan stridently opposed it. Japan made it clear it does not even want discussion on the 4.9-million-square-kilometre marine protected area (MPA) that is backed by United States Secretary of State John Kerry. The Ross Sea, or "Last Ocean", plan went before last year's Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) but failed for lack of consensus, and decision-making was moved to a meeting to be held in Bremerhaven, Germany, from July 11 to 16. A near-fatal blow to the plan was delivered this week in Brussels at a meeting of the obscure Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) - a technical gathering of 450 delegates from 50 parties, including New Zealand. Its final communique yesterday makes no mention of the MPA, but an account of mostly closed-door discussion was issued by the Washington-based Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition. Belgium proposed a motion to support CCAMLR's process on creating the MPA, and this was backed by Prince Albert of Monaco, who at the opening called for the creation not just of the Ross Sea MPA, but also one in East Antarctica proposed by Australia, the European Union and France. The coalition said Belgium's resolution to support the MPA process "gained widespread support but was shot down at the end by China and Japan". Japan already refuses to recognise the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. The coalition said Japan even objected to the ATCM expressing any kind of support for the work of CCAMLR and did not want reference to it in the final report.</content>

		<title>Phone records would pinpoint leak - Peters</title>
		<description>NZ First leader Winston Peters is demanding the release of phone records to pinpoint the source of the leak in the Government Communications Security Bureau inquiry.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8739140/Phone-records-would-pinpoint-leak-Peters</link>
		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>NZ First leader Winston Peters is demanding the release of phone records to pinpoint the source of the leak in the Government Communications Security Bureau inquiry. Mr Peters has used parliamentary privilege to accuse UnitedFuture leader Peter Dunne of leaking a report by Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Kitteridge into potentially illegal spying by the GCSB. Mr Dunne has categorically denied the allegation but has confirmed he has been spoken to more than once by inquiry head David Henry. Other ministers who received the report have said they were not interviewed by Mr Henry. In Parliament yesterday, Mr Peters questioned Mr Henry's failure to take evidence under oath, or keep an electronic record of witnesses' answers to questions. He also questioned the failure to examine phone records of "particular ministers". "All the evidence is in those phone records, and your minister is gone," Mr Peters told Deputy Prime Minister Bill English. Mr English said later it was entirely up to Mr Henry whether to seek phone records. "If he thinks phone records will tell him something I'm sure he will go and get them. I'm a bit surprised at the detailed knowledge Mr Peters had about the way Mr Henry is doing his job." He conceded that ministers would normally consider their phone records confidential. But the prime minister's office and chief executive of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet had made it clear to all ministerial offices that they were expected to cooperate fully with the inquiry, Mr English said. Prime Minister John Key doubted the culprit would be found. "History tells you it's very, very difficult to prove these things." He said he did not have any inside information and was yet to see Mr Henry's report. "But in the history of looking for sources of leaks my 11-year experience of Parliament is it's difficult to pin it down because there are just so many opportunities for people to do things without leaving fingerprints." Mr Dunne told a select committee on Wednesday he did not leak the report and later told reporters it was under lock and key most of the time it was in his possession. Mr Key said he had not sought any further assurances from Mr Dunne and did not need to. "He's made very public statements and statements to a select committee for which he is bound by the rules of Parliament to be honest and upfront with his answers. "I accept him absolutely at his word ... I've got no reason to doubt that."</content>

		<title>Cartoons no joke for the poor - Devoy</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8739113/Cartoons-no-joke-for-the-poor-Devoy</link>
		<category>national</category>
		<content>Race Relations Commissioner Susan Devoy has questioned the high threshold for a finding of racism after cartoons about the Government's breakfast-in-schools programme created controversy. Award-winning cartoonist Al Nisbet's works were printed in the Express Wednesday and yesterday. Ms Devoy said the cartoon was offensive and appalling. "It continues to stereotype certain populations and it continues to stigmatise people who live in poverty, particularly children," she said. The cartoons were stereotyping Polynesians as spending their money on cigarettes and gambling. "That is wrong ... Some parents living in poverty do their very, very, very best to feed their children, and probably don't even rely on food in schools and other things," Ms Devoy said. The cartoons did not reach the level of racism within the commission's inquiries and complaints process. The threshold under the law was "very high" and was about inciting racial disharmony. "Perhaps it is not right that the threshold is that high" but that was a matter for the Government, she said. The Human Rights Commission could still address the issue, and she encouraged people to complain to the commission, the editors of the newspapers and the Press Council. Ms Devoy said the editors should apologise. "I am an editor, not a censor, and we regularly publish content that expresses a range of views, and this is just one of those. "Our cartoon very clearly had people from a range of ethnic backgrounds, some of whom were from the Maori and Pacific community and some of whom were from Pakeha communities. "People have interpreted that as a racist attack. In my view, it's not." "The intention was always to provoke discussion around a really important social issue and I think we might be losing sight of that." Nisbet said he was not racist, and the cartoons were not intended to be so. Rather, it was directed at anyone who complained about poverty and "blow their money on booze, fags and pokies". "They [complainers] always point at the dark figures they never look at the white ones," he said. Prime Minister John Key said he had not seen the cartoons but he tried not to comment on cartoons. "I'm often the source of the humour in them ... and I try to take it all with a grain of salt because cartoonists are notorious for taking a mile out of an inch."</content>

		<title>Lombard four face time in 'gilded cages'</title>
		<description>Former Lombard Finance director and ex-National Cabinet minister Sir Douglas Graham could face up to a year wearing an electronic ankle bracelet on home detention in one of his two substantial houses.</description>

		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>Former Lombard Finance director and ex-National Cabinet minister Sir Douglas Graham could face up to a year wearing an electronic ankle bracelet on home detention in one of his two substantial houses. But it looks like he will hold on to his knighthood for now. The Court of Appeal said yesterday that a High Court sentence of community service handed down last year was "manifestly inadequate", and that Graham and three other directors could have faced prison. The Court of Appeal said "the starting point" should have been 2 years prison for Graham, Bill Jeffries and Lawrence Bryant, and 2 years for Michael Reeves, the former chief executive, discounted to 18 months and 2 years respectively for mitigating factors. In April 2008, Lombard collapsed into receivership, owing $111 million to about 3600 unsecured investors. The Court of Appeal said that the sentences imposed by the High Court did not reflect the "gravity of the offending", the number of investors affected and the substantial amounts of money - more than $10m - invested in reliance on a prospectus sent out just a few months before Lombard failed. The court rejected the four men's appeals against their High Court convictions. It will consider final sentence after it gets a report back on their homes "for home detention purposes". The courts do not have to take into consideration how grand a house might be, as long as the electronic ankle alarm can be monitored. The four men all own substantial homes that could soon turn into gilded cages. Companies Office documents show Graham has a semi-detached home in Remuera and is also listed at a large home in Drury. Jeffries has a large home in Pinehaven, Upper Hutt. Reeves has an apartment in upmarket Princes Wharf in Auckland, while Bryant has a large home on a rural property close to Masterton, understood to be near film-maker Sir Peter Jackson's mansion and estate. The four were convicted in the High Court in February last year on four counts of making untrue statements in a Lombard prospectus issued at Christmas in 2007. The firm fell over in April 2008. Former Lombard Finance investor Paul Wah, of Wellington, said Graham should be stripped of his knighthood, after "rolling the dice" to appeal against the conviction. Legal experts say that would be a first in New Zealand, although people have had their knighthoods stripped in Britain. Prime Minister John Key said he would seek advice on whether Graham should lose his title, but it would be a big step to take. "It's a very significant event for someone to get a knighthood ... he got that for tremendous service for Treaty settlements - along with Jim Bolger, he blazed a trail for what has been an important part of the healing process and reconciliation for New Zealand." But Mr Wah asked: "When is it appropriate to have a convicted criminal with the title of Sir?" He was at a special meeting of Lombard investors chaired by Graham, just a few months before the collapse. "He exhorted people to reinvest their money ... that sticks in my craw."</content>

		<category>sport/rugby</category>
		<content>All Blacks wing Hosea Gear has signed with French club Toulouse. Gear is expected to leave New Zealand Rugby at the end of the season. New Zealand Rugby Union chief executive Steve Tew confirmed Gear's pending departure last night. "I've got no feel for what Toulouse have offered," Tew said. "The French have been a little bit quieter of late... let's hope it's not the awakening of their wallets. "At the end of the day we negotiated a contract with Hosea that gave him the opportunity to make a decision now. Obviously we would have preferred to keep him here, but ultimately we will respect the decision he made. Since making his international debut in 2008, Gear has played just 14 tests for the All Blacks. He also played 70 Super Rugby games for the Hurricanes and Highlanders and represented Poverty Bay, North Harbour and Wellington in the NPC. Three years ago Sir Graham Henry described Gear as the best winger in the world. There is little doubt his explosive qualities will be a loss, the timing of his decision suggests he would have missed the cut for next month's three-test series France. The All Blacks name their squad on Sunday. Earlier this year Gear seemed to be in top form with the captaincy duties at the Highlanders, but during the latter stages of a difficult campaign with the southerners he has struggled to find his best. Last year, while competing for the left wing spot, Gear played six of a possible 14 tests. It appears he has been overtaken by the Hurricanes' Julian Savea, but with Cory Jane out injured the All Blacks are not flush with outside back options. The Blues trio of Rene Ranger, Frank Halai and Charles Piutau are possible replacements. "We haven't got a lot of depth in the outside backs and midfield. They are two areas that cause us more concern than most," Tew said. Gear's departure could also be a loss for New Zealand Sevens coach Gordon Tietjens. Having won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2010 Gear was a firm prospect for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Gear, who will link with former All Black Luke McAlister at Toulouse, and his agent Warren Alcock, could not be reached last night, while Highlanders chief executive Roger Clark and assistant coach Scott McLeod declined to</content>

		<title>MPs walk out of question time</title>

		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>Labour MP Trevor Mallard and the entire NZ First caucus have walked out of Parliament in a protest. Mallard was the first to leave and NZ First leader Winston Peters then announced his entire party was leaving in protest over Speaker David Carter's ruling over the United Future Party. The Electoral Commission last week announced United Future would be de-registered as a political party after failing to prove its membership. Leader Peter Dunne this afternoon announced his party would seek to be re-registered on Monday. "We always actually had more than 500 names, it was the question of with various organisations, officers change and the standard of the record keeping wasn't actually that good," he said before entering Parliament. Carter ruled Dunne could keep the parliamentary entitlements he receives because of his status as the leader of a party. He gave Dunne "some time to put the matter right". "I have made my decision, my decision stands." Opposition parties questioned his ruling and said Dunne should lose the entitlements, including additional funding given to leaders. Mallard said that made Parliament a "farce". He was asked to apologise but refused saying he would rather leave the debating chamber. Peters then said if Carter would not release the legal advise behind his decision, NZ First MPs would also leave the House. And they did. State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman also left after he refused to apologise for calling Labour MP Phil Goff a "coward". Parliament seemed to be falling as Carter became increasingly frustrated. "If we want a record number today we're certainly heading the right way," he said. Outside Parliament Mallard said he was upset at Speaker making a ruling which he did not believe he was entitled to. ''It is very clear that Mr Dunne is now an independent member''. This had implications for the way he voted and could affect $100,000 of funding for his office, Mallard said. His departure was motivated by ''a sense of the importance of Parliament'', Mallard said. The House had a set of standing orders which were ''effectively our Bible for making sure that we have a democracy'' and it was not up to the Speaker to ignore them.</content>

		<title>Violent boy leaves school 'trapped'</title>
		<description>Parents are threatening to remove their children from a Waikato school if a young boy with a violent history is allowed to return.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/8761374/Violent-boy-leaves-school-trapped</link>
		<category>national/education</category>
		<content>Parents are threatening to remove their children from a Waikato school if a young boy with a violent history is allowed to return. Education bosses are ordering Paeroa Central School to re-enrol the boy, despite warnings from police and a mental-health expert that he poses a major threat to the safety of others. But the school is refusing to take him back, fearing his return will put staff and pupils in danger. The 10-year-old was excluded from the decile one school in August after he assaulted a teacher and told pupils aged 5 and 6 that he would "cut them up" with a knife. Principal Janet Jones said parents will take their children out of school if the boy returns as he would likely harm someone again. ''I think parents will remove their children and I already have two board members saying they will take their children out, so we stand to lose a teacher. ''I feel like we're just trapped in a really difficult position because it has implications in terms of employing staff, it has implications for the school roll and it has implications for the safety of children and staff.'' The Education Ministry has now told Jones she must re-enrol the boy by tomorrow, despite his violent history. She is refusing. Jones has found support from a relative of the boy, anti-violence campaigner Paora Raharaha, who says the youngster should be placed in alternative education. The boy has attended 14 schools, including one in Hamilton from which he was excluded after trying to assault staff with a cricket bat. The boy - whose father is understood to be a senior Mongrel Mob member recently released from prison - has spent three months living rough on Paeroa streets after escaping from Child, Youth and Family care. He was living with an aunt, who enrolled him at the school in August. He lasted four days before being excluded. His offending includes threatening to stab pupils, punching, kicking and spitting at others, and assaulting a teacher. The ministry asked the school to take the boy back, offering it about $34,000 in funding from the intensive wraparound service for severely troubled children. "We declined," Jones said. But, at the start of this year, the ministry directed the board to lift the exclusion and enrol him in April. The school appealed to Education Minister Hekia Parata, who refused to get involved. An email on May 31 from ministry acting manager Rachel Fox said the board was "in breach of legal obligations" and its concerns were "not valid reasons" to deny him entry. "I am just appalled and astounded really, because I feel like [the ministry's] not supporting us at all," Jones said. "This child is way different from any child we've had come through the school and we've had some tough ones." Ministry special education group manager Brian Coffey yesterday told the Times it was rare to direct a school to enrol a pupil but the risks to others and the needs of the boy were carefully considered. "The student is receiving a range of support from specialists through the intensive wraparound service, which will support him at school, in the community and at home over the next two years.</content>

		<content>As the All Blacks coach delivered the news that Dan Carter was out for the first two tests of the French series, Steve Hansen did his best to look solemn and disappointed. But the reality is the Carter's enforced absence fits perfectly with his plan for this three-test series which starts on Saturday night at the scene of their epic World Cup final in 2011. So while Hansen was outwardly grave that the broken right hand will force Carter to miss both the Eden Park and Christchurch contests, inwardly he might have been smiling just a little. With Carter, halfback Piri Weepu (head knock) and loosehead prop Tony Woodcock (inner nose abscess) all ruled out of Saturday night's opening test of the season, it has allowed Hansen to advance his plan significantly. Also factor in that Richie McCaw (sabbatical) is sitting out this series and Sam Whitelock (broken finger) and Cory Jane (knee) are both sidelined. All are first-choice All Blacks when fit. So while the match 23 for Saturday contains only two debutants - prop Ben Afeaki and lock Jeremy Thrush, both on the bench - it also includes a healthy swag of what might be called next-generation players. And that's just fine by Hansen. "We've already said that this year we've got to take some risks and give people opportunities to play and establish whether they're the future or not, and that's what we've got to do," Hansen said today. "Only two guys have their debut so I think we're managing the process pretty well. We've just got to now back it up." So that makes this a big test for a group of players who have a clear chance to advance their claims. Included in that are loosehad prop Wyatt Crockett (11 tests), hooker Dane Coles (four), flanker Sam Cane (four), first-five Aaron Cruden (20) and utility Ben Smith (12). You could probably throw lock Luke Romano (11 tests) and halfback Aaron Smith (13) into that category too, as players relatively new to this level still forging their identities and their reputations. Hansen spoke about the "long-term plan" he has with Coles and that even the veteran hookers in the squad had bought into the fact that they needed to advance the education of the 26-year-old Hurricanes No 2. The same theory could be applied to Crockett stepping up as a successor to Woodcock whose powers may be declining, and to Cruden preparing to fill the boots of Carter whose abilities remain pretty sharp.</content>

		<title>Stranger's kindness leads to mega win</title>

		<category>world/americas</category>
		<content>An 84-year-old Florida widow who bought her Powerball ticket after another customer let her get ahead in line has claimed the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in US history: US$590 million (NZ$743m). Gloria MacKenzie, a retiree from Maine and a mother of four who lives in a modest, tin-roof house in Zephyrhills, where the lone winning ticket in the May 18 drawing was sold, took her prize in a lump sum of just over US$370 million. After federal taxes, she is getting about US$278 million, lottery officials said. She did not speak to a crowd of reporters outside lottery headquarters, leaving quickly in a silver Ford Focus with her son and family friends. She was accompanied at the lottery offices by two unidentified attorneys. MacKenzie bought the winning ticket at a Publix supermarket in the town of about 13,300, northeast of Tampa. It is best known for the bottled spring water that bears its name - and now, for one of the biggest lottery winners of all time. The US$590 million was the second-largest lottery jackpot in history, behind a US$656 million Mega Millions prize in March 2012, but that sum was split, with three winning tickets. In a statement read by lottery officials, MacKenzie said she purchased the ticket after another buyer "was kind enough to let me go ahead in line." MacKenzie let the lottery computers generate the numbers at random. She said she also bought four other tickets for the drawing. "We are grateful with this blessing of winning the Florida Lottery Powerball jackpot," the statement said. "We hope that everyone would give us the opportunity to maintain our privacy for our family's benefit." The winner had 60 days to claim the prize. Lottery spokesman David Bishop said MacKenzie, her lawyers and her financial adviser spent about two hours going through the necessary paperwork. "They had clearly been preparing for this. They took all this time to get everything in order," Bishop said. Minutes after the announcement, a dozen reporters in Zephyrhills were camped outside MacKenzie's gray duplex, which backs up to a dirt alley and is across from a cow pasture. MacKenzie's neighbours offered few details about her life. They said she mostly kept to herself, but they've seen her take short walks along the street and exchanged pleasantries with her. Her house, situated among mostly mobile homes and pre-fabricated houses, has a chain-link fence with a sheet-metal roof and an old TV antenna.</content>

		<content>An advertisement showing a woman's breasts resting on an open-home sign under the title of "A great pair" has been ruled a breach of the Advertising Standard Authority (ASA) code of practice. But Waitakere Real Estate, owned by a husband and wife team of former police officers, said the ad was not sexist, but eventually removed it from a real estate website. The reference to "A great pair", Gary and Yolanda Atkins argued, was to the fact that they were offering two properties in the advertisement. In a written decision, the authority said a complainant, J Sugrue, lodged a brief complaint: "I think the picture speaks for itself. Ad title is 'A Great Pair?' Possibly funny but disgustingly sexist." A lawyer for Waitakere Real Estate told the authority that the company rejected the complaint. "The full text of the advertisement itself taking 10 lines in total on the website advertisement does not disclose anything that could be remotely stated as ... 'disgustingly sexist'." The lawyer said the ad complied with the law and was not misleading or deceptive. In a 72-word sentence, the lawyer said, the ad was prepared "with a due sense of social responsibility and respected the principles of free and fair competition". "The photo of the woman's breasts was a case of using anatomy as a drawcard ... which is undertaken by all media outlets at all times in every publication in New Zealand." The lawyer added: "It was not misleading as it was referring to a 'pair' of properties that were for sale. It was therefore factually correct." The authority did not agree. The breasts were "intended to be a humorous, risque interpretation to advertise the open home [and] it was exploitative in nature". The advertiser by using sexual appeal to draw attention to an unrelated product had been in breach of the Code for People in Advertising. "As a result ... the complaints board said the advertisement had not been prepared with a due sense of social responsibility and it was also in breach of ... the code of ethics," it</content>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8764059/HNZ-chairman-resigns-over-potential-conflict</link>
		<category>national</category>
		<content>The chairman of Housing New Zealand (HNZ) has stood down because of a potential conflict of interest. Housing Minister Nick Smith today announced he had accepted the resignation of board chairman Alan Jackson. Jackson's role as a director at Fletcher Building had become an issue because of the building work HNZ was undertaking. "Dr Jackson wrote to me earlier this week to let me know he would be stepping down as chair to avoid a potential conflict of interest with his role as a director at Fletcher Building," Smith said. "Given the scale and pace of new work by Housing New Zealand, including the massive rebuild programme in Christchurch, of which Fletcher Building may potentially tender for, he considered it was untenable to continue in both roles." At the end of last month, Smith previously described HNZ's contribution to the rebuild as "the biggest Government house building programme in Christchurch's history". Smith said Jackson had done a "splendid job", particularly in contributing to the evolution of state housing. "He has also done an outstanding job in improving the performance of Housing New Zealand. I am disappointed to be losing his skills but support his decision given the potential conflict of interest." Deputy chairwoman Adrienne Young-Cooper will be acting chairwoman until a new one is appointed.</content>

		<title>Stephen Fry talks of suicide attempt</title>
		<description>Hobbit star Stephen Fry has admitted he tried to commit suicide last year.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/celebrities/8762444/Stephen-Fry-talks-of-suicide-attempt</link>
		<category>entertainment/celebrities</category>
		<content>Hobbit star Stephen Fry has admitted he tried to commit suicide last year. He was only saved when a producer found him unconscious in his hotel room. In an interview for Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast, Fry said it was the first time he had spoken of it in public, "but I might as well..." "'I would go as far as to tell you that I attempted it last year, so that I'm not always happy. Previously he had spoken about his struggle with bipolar disorder and how he feared he may attempt suicide. The interview was part of British comedian Herring's series of podcasts for the British Comedy Guide website. It was conducted in front of a live audience on Monday (local time). "And, um, it was a close-run thing. I took a huge number of pills with a large amount of vodka and the mixture of them made my body convulse so much that I broke four ribs, but I was still unconscious," he said. "And, fortunately, the producer I was filming with at the time came into the hotel room and I was found in a sort of unconscious state and taken back to England and looked after." Fry did not reveal where it happened or the programme or movie he was filming at the time. He is president of a mental health foundation called Mind, and felt that he had to lead by example in talking about his own experiences with depression. "...the whole point is in my role as I see it is not to be shy and forthcoming about the morbidity and genuine nature of the likelihood of death amongst people with certain mood disorders if they don't look after it, if they think they can do without their medication or without the regular visits to a doctor, without taking care of themselves." In a 2011 interview Fry revealed he found the demands of fame "exhausting" - and feared he may one day kill himself. "The fact that I am lucky enough not to have it so seriously doesn't mean I won't one day kill myself - I may well," he said. Fry came close to committing suicide in 1995 after his West End play Cell Mates had received poor reviews. He fled Britain by ferry and was missing for a week before he was found in Belgium. Before Fry was found it was feared he was dead. He later revealed that he came close to gassing himself before he eventually left for Belgium. "But I had this image of my parents staring right in at me... so I decided not to do it". Below is a list of some of the services available which offer support, information and help. All services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week unless otherwise specified.</content>

		<title>Frantic search after US building collapses</title>

		<category>world/americas</category>
		<content>Two people are after a building in Philadelphia that was being torn down collapsed with a thunderous boom, raining bricks on a neighbouring shop. Rescue teams pulled at least 13 other people from mountains of crushed concrete and splintered wood, using buckets and their bare hands, as well as search dogs to scour the rubble for others. A woman, aged 35, was killed in the incident, the city's mayor said. No information about the other person was known. Rescuers pulled another woman, trapped amid the rubble of a Salvation Army thrift store, after they heard her voice, city fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers said. The injured were rushed to area hospitals, Ayes said. Most of those injuries were minor. Reports said another body was spotted in the basement of the building but rescuers were struggling to reach it. When the building caved in the Salvation Army Thrift Store next door was crowded with shoppers who turned out for its weekly "Half-Off" sale. Roofers and painters who were working nearby spent about 10 to 15 minutes pulling people out before rescue workers and firefighters arrived on the scene. Witnesses said they heard a loud rumbling sound immediately before the collapse. "I was standing there looking out my window, watching the men at work on the building, and the next thing I know I heard something go kaboom," said Veronica Haynes, who was on the fifth floor of an apartment building across the street. "Then you saw the whole side of the wall fall down ... onto the other building." Patrick Glynn and Anthony Soli were working on a roof atop a nearby building when they heard what sounded like two loud bangs or explosions. They immediately ran down the scaffolding and helped pull out two women and a man. Glynn said he had been watching workers take down the doomed building over the past few weeks, and said he suspected a collapse was inevitable because of the methods the workers were using to tear it down. "For weeks they've been standing on the edge, knocking bricks off," he said. "You could just see it was ready to go at any time. I knew it was going to happen." Carlton Williams of the city's Department of Licenses and Inspections said there were no existing violations on the building and the demolition company had proper permits for the work they were doing. Bernie DiTomo was driving past Salvation Army building in his white pickup truck, on his way to an appointment, when the collapse happened. "The next thing you know, I heard a rumble, and a building and a sign fell on my truck," he said. He said he lay down in the seat of his cab. It was probably over in about 30 seconds, he said. There was a lot of dirt and dust that he breathed in, but he was able to open the door and get out, unhurt. His truck remained nearby, partially covered in debris, as DiTomo watched recovery efforts from across the street. Dan Gillis, a construction worker on a job across the street, said he saw a crane remove a supporting beam from the front of the building, and then the wall next to the thrift store started swaying.</content>

		<content>Singer Miguel's title="stage dive at this year's Billboard Music Awards" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/8695223/Billboard-awards-epic-jump-kick-fail" target="_blank">stage dive at this year's Billboard Music could become the subject of legal action over claims of possible brain damage to a female fan. Khyati Shah's head got caught under the B star's leg as he tried to leap from one stage to another while singing his track Adorn during the televised awards in Las Vegas in May. Vision of the incident went live to air on US channel ABC, with slow motion versions mocking him since being uploaded to YouTube. TMZ reports that Miguel was ordered not to attempt the jump during his song Adorn "because producers believed it was too dangerous". Unnamed sources, purportedly connected to the production, told TMZ: "Miguel approached producers before rehearsals and asked if he could try to jump over the crowd during his performance but producers shot down the idea." After the incident, Miguel emerged from backstage with Shah, who was holding an icepack, and told Billboard: "Well, I think it's kind of clear what happened. But I'm very happy to bring my new friend, Khyati, we just met. Unfortunately, we did not meet under the best circumstances, but I think we're okay." Shah responded: "I Adorn [sic] him." But Shah's lawyer, Vip Bola, now claims that his client should have been taken to hospital rather than offered an icepack. "Some of the difficulties she's experiencing are cognitive in nature and lead to suspicion of a neurological head injury," he told TMZ. They are reportedly waiting for test results from a neurologist, before deciding to pursue a lawsuit. There was no official response to the allegations from Miguel, who has remained silent on Twitter about the awards, or the Billboard Music Awards organisers.</content>

		<title>Bananas in Pyjamas dumped</title>
		<description>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has ceased production of its iconic children's television program, Bananas in Pyjamas.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv/8764481/Bananas-in-Pyjamas-dumped</link>
		<category>entertainment/tv</category>
		<content>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has ceased production of its iconic children's television program, Bananas in Pyjamas. The last of 156 episodes of the animated version of the original 1992 live-action series will air at the end of the month, one month before the Bananas turn 21. The ABC's head of children's content, Tim Brooke-Hunt, said that even though the program is watched by an average of 380,000 viewers in Australia, and is the public network's biggest-selling children's product on the international market, screening in 130 countries, Bananas in Pyjamas does not generate enough revenue to justify a fourth season. "It is a matter of money. Although we have been nicely treated by the government in the context of funding of our school-age channel, ABC3, the reality is that ABC4Kids (on ABC2), is funded from the previously existing, general allocation for the ABC," Brooke-Hunt said. He said international merchandise sales, rather than screening rights, were key to the program's longevity, and that overseas sales of toys, books and DVDs connected with the current series were disappointing compared with the "millions of dollars a year" in merchandise profits generated by the original series at the height of its />Advertisement The animated series, in which the ABC invested an estimated $100,000 per half-hour of screen time, will continue to be repeated on ABC2. Brooke-Hunt said the network would not consider commissioning another season for at least two years, and that overseas merchandise figures would be a deciding factor in any future decisions to renew the program. Executive producer of the current series, Barbara Uecker, the former head of German children's television channel, KiKA, said the ABC's decision not to commission a fourth season was a "sad moment" for the production team. Bananas split: the ABC invested an estimated $100,000 per half-hour of screen time in the animated series. "It was a huge responsibility to work with these iconic characters. We were very careful to keep the essence of the original series that made it so popular, and to keep the values. "These Bananas are just adorable characters. They want to help everybody. Of course we introduced a few new characters. We didn't want to just produce a ninth season." Four hundred episodes of the original series were produced from 1992 until 2001, and repeated over the following nine years. Creators Claire Henderson and Simon Hopkinson refused to comment on the animated version, with which they are not involved, but attributed the characters' enduring popularity to their vision for non-educational children's entertainment a radical concept in what Hopkinson described as the socially conscious children's programming landscape of the early 1990s. "Everything else (at the time) had a heart-on-the-sleeve attitude that if you were doing preschool television, you had to be teaching children social values. Our pitch was to come up with five-minute funny stories," said Hopkinson.</content>

		<content>The 15-year-old daughter of Michael Jackson is physically fine after being taken to a hospital early Wednesday, an attorney for Jackson's mother said. Perry Sanders Jr. wrote in a statement hat Paris Jackson is getting appropriate medical attention and the family is seeking privacy. "Being a sensitive 15 year old is difficult no matter who you are," he wrote. "It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you. Paris is physically fine and is getting appropriate medical attention. Please respect her privacy and the family's privacy." Sanders declined further comment on Paris' condition or the circumstances that led to her hospitalisation. Fire and sheriff's officials confirmed they transported someone from a home in Paris' suburban Calabasas neighbourhood for a possible overdose but did not release any identifying information or additional details. Paris frequently posts messages about her life on Twitter, where she has more than a million followers. One of her most recent posts was from the Beatles' song Yesterday: "yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they're here to stay." Another post included the question, "I wonder why tears are salty?" you say i need therapy , well , my darling , so do you . don't need for you to tell me what is wrong in all i say or do Paris (@ParisJackson) href="https://twitter.com/ParisJackson/status/342043736924114944">June 4,</content>

		<content>A Dunedin transport firm has to pay a former driver $12,000 in lost wages and compensation, after a manager at the firm allegedly hit the worker with a stepladder and another time told the worker he would "like to beat the shit out of him". Employment Relations Authority member Christine Hickey found driver and loader Robert Kereopa was unjustifiably dismissed from his job at Elrich Enterprises which trades as Hanson Removals. Kereopa had said he and Hanson Removals' operations manager Richard Wichman got into an argument at an end of year work function in December 2011, Hickey said in her decision. At one point someone yelled at Kereopa to duck and as he turned he saw Wichman swinging a metal stepladder towards him. Kereopa raised his arms to protect his head and Wichman allegedly hit him with the stepladder catching his left ribs and left arm. Police were called but Kereopa did not press charges, the decision said. In a statement of evidence, Wichman had said it was not him, but another man who assaulted Kereopa at the Christmas party, hitting him on the left side with a chair. Wichman had also accused Kereopa of theft and breaking his work mobile phone. But Elrich Enterprises had not made any counter claim against Kereopa so the informal claims could not be determined, the decision said. In late April 2012, Kereopa was helping shift a piano which fell on his foot, injuring his ankle. Kereopa, and a staff member giving first aid, said Kereopa could not drive but Wichman said he had to drive despite the injury. "Mr Kereopa again refused. Then Mr Wichman got into the truck cab. Mr Kereopa hopped over to the driver's side and Mr Wichman said, 'f*** you, you're fired'," the decision said. Wichman then said: "No, I'm not going through this shit. I've been taken too many times. It's your call. But hand in your f***ing keys." Kereopa returned his keys to Wichman who drove the truck away, leaving Kereopa at the job site without transport back to Dunedin from Port Chalmers. On the phone a few days later Wichman had asked Kereopa why he was not at work, and Kereopa had said it was because he had been fired. Wichman denied firing Kereopa and said Kereopa had abandoned his employment. Wichman said: "F*** this. I'm going to your f***ing house and I'm going to smash you." By his own admission, Wichman: "... lost my temper with him and told him I'd like to beat the shit out of him", the decision said. Kereopa reported Wichman's threat to the police the next day and issued a trespass notice preventing Wichman going to his home.</content>

		<content>The famed bikinis section of the Miss World competition has been axed to respect the cultural traditions of this year's host country. Miss World 2013 is to be held in the Indonesian resort Island of Bali. Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim nations. Women from more than 130 countries will compete for the crown, but instead of wearing bikinis in the beachwear section, the ladies will model more modest attire, including artistically place sarongs. Deputy tourism and creative economy minister Sapta Nirwandar, reportedly told Indonesian journalists that the government had requested Miss World's organising committee respect the Indonesian rules. Although Bali's beaches are packed with tourists in skimpy bathing wear, Miss World Organisation chair Julia Morley said the competing pageanters would not be wearing bikinis. "I don't want to upset or get anyone in a situation where we are being disrespectful," she told Agence France-Presse. "We treasure respect for all the countries that take part in the pageant," she said.</content>

		<title>Prison more interesting than home</title>

		<content>A 19-year-old convict on home detention is serving the final month of his sentence in prison because he found home life too boring. In an interview href="http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Convict-opts-for-jail-cell-ahead-of-home-detention/tabid/506/articleID/35863/Default.aspx " target="_blank">with Marcus Lush on this morning, Whangarei Senior Constable Paul Nicholas told of how the Whangarei teen - 10 months into an 11-month sentence of home detention - called police when it finally came to be too much. Begging to be allowed to spend the rest of his sentence in prison, he threatened to remove his electronic monitoring bracelet if police didn't oblige. Nicholas told Lush if the man had removed his ankle bracelet, police would have been forced to arrest him anyway for breach of his conditions. He said it was an "odd" situation. "It's the first time I've ever come across it... Perhaps he should have brought a PS3," he told Lush. Nicholas said he had known the man for a while. "He was in a fairly rural address, so whether he just didn't have any visitors or not... we don't know [why he wanted to go to prison]." Nicholas told Lush he definitely would have followed through with the threat, which left police and the Department of Corrections "on the spot". The teen is now spending the next month at the Ngawha Prison in Northland.</content>

		<category>sport/cricket</category>
		<content>They had to fall back to earth some time, but this was more of a thud than New Zealand would have liked. The Black Caps' bid to claim their second ODI cricket series clean sweep against England came unstuck with a 34-run defeat in game three at Trent Bridge this morning (NZT). Chasing 288 to win, the tourists were dismissed for 253 off 46.3 overs to remove a little gloss from consecutive one-day series victories in England. Ross Taylor's knock of 71 - his fourth successive half-century of the tour - was a lone hand for New Zealand who lost regular wickets in a bid to replicate their 3-0 sweep against England at home in 1982-83. It was going to be difficult to sustain such dominance but this will be a reality check for New Zealand ahead of their Champions Trophy opener against Sri Lanka on Sunday. England showed something like their real form, too, after some terribly flat performances at Lord's and the Rose Bowl. With the series already won, New Zealand can be cut some slack but they will be kicking themselves for letting England back into the contest before the teams meet again in their final Champions Trophy group match on June 16. This performance raised familiar concerns about their composure against spin, and caused worry lines about the death-bowling amid a brutal assault by England's Jos Buttler who blazed an unbeaten 47 off 16 balls. It also signalled an end to Martin Guptill's remarkable run. Having nailed back-to-back centuries, including a New Zealand record 189 not out, the opener looked set for more but was bowled through the gate by off-spinner James Tredwell for 38. It was his first dismissal of the series, having plundered 330 runs. New Zealand made a flying start but, unlike the first two games, no one in the top order seized control against a revamped England bowling attack. Injured pacemen Stuart Broad (2-56) and Steven Finn (2-57) returned while James Anderson and Graeme Swann were rested, giving Tredwell (3-51) his chance. Luke Ronchi (22) played one big shot too many and Kane Williamson (19) hit loosely across the line to Joe Root to hand the part-time spinner his first ODI wicket. The recalled Colin Munro, in for Grant Elliott (tight calf), faced just one delivery and when skipper Brendon McCullum and James Franklin both nicked out cheaply it was a sickly 122-6. Taylor was New Zealand's last hope and he added 53 with Nathan McCullum.</content>

		<title>Baby Blacks beat ill-disciplined Fiji</title>

		<category>sport/rugby</category>
		<content>New Zealand trounced an ill-disciplined Fiji 59-6 to win their opening pool game at the IRB Junior world championships in Vannes, France this morning. Although the easy win signalled they are capable of challenging for the title, the flurry of red and yellow cards issued by referee Andrew McMenemy (CRCT) against the Fijians overshadowed their achievement. Any chance 11th seed Fiji had of upsetting New Zealand, last s beaten finalist, evaporated when received two red – one in each half – and three yellow cards. The match plunged to the farcical situation early in the second half where Fiji were forced to play with just 11 players after they lost loosehead prop Sunia Tamani and left wing Timilai Rokoduru for dangerous tackles. The latter call was correct but Rokoduru could feel harshly punished for a mis-timed tackle that t appear malicious. The first major blow for Fiji, however, was when second five-eighth Sevanaia Galala was harshly red-carded for a tip-tackle on lock Patrick Tuipulotu in the 30th minute. The misery was compounded a couple of minutes after that incident when centre Nasoni Kunavore was sin-binned and there was never going to be any chance of them recovering from this setback. McMenemy asked the Fijians to be more disciplined when he spoke to them in the tunnel at halftime but t satisfied they had heeded the warnings. His decision to red card replacement forward Viliame Rarasea for another dangerous tackle came in the 53rd minute, ensuring Fiji were going never going to be able to assemble a defensive line capable of keeping the New Zealand attack at bay. New Zealand coach Chris Boyd will have been satisfied to get the expected win but will be eager to get his players back onto the training pitch to knock off the rust that plagued them for periods of the match. He is also expected to call for another prop after loosehead Alexander Hodgman left the field with what appeared to be a broken arm. Talented fullback Lolagi Visinia was also forced to leave the field because of a shoulder complaint. While Boyd will have been pleased to get his campaign off to a winning start he will be looking to improve the kick-off receipts and execution around the breakdown before meeting Australia in their next match in four days. A desire to move the ball wide ensured the New Zealanders backline were often employed on the fringes and midfielder Michael Collins proved one of their best on attack.</content>

		<content>Bob Edwards was born before the first Model T rolled out of Henry Ford's factory in Detroit. He learned to drive in a French car that had a lever instead of a steering wheel. And he's still on the road, only now in a red four-wheel-drive Mitsubishi. The oldest licensed driver in New Zealand, and one of the oldest in the world, has been driving for 88 of his 105 years and has no plans to give it up, just as he intends to keep working out every morning in his home gym, and to keep regularly cooking meals for himself and his wife, who's 91. "In fact, I don't think I'm old," Edwards says. "Not really." He's been involved in just one crash in his life and has been handed just one speeding ticket, a citation that still gets him riled up years later. When he broke his left hip three years ago, his doctors said to stop driving for six weeks but he didn't pay them much mind. After all, he says, he drives an automatic and only needs his right leg for that. In New Zealand, drivers older than 80 must have their health and vision tested every two years to stay on the road. Many countries in Europe and US states have similar requirements. While stories about elderly drivers making mistakes or causing crashes often make headlines, it's young drivers who tend to cause the most damage. "Older drivers, on a per-kilometre-driven basis, are involved in far fewer crashes than younger drivers," said Andy Knackstedt, a spokesman for the New Zealand Transport Agency, which oversees driver testing. He said that for many elderly people, retaining a license helps them maintain their independence, mobility and dignity. "Our job is really to balance that with the need to make sure our roads are safe," he says. According to Guinness World Records, the world's oldest driver was American Fred Hale Sr who was on the road until his 108th birthday in 1998. Edwards drives three times a week to the store 15 kilometres down the road. He picks up groceries on Sundays and the newspapers on other days. Occasionally, he says, he'll drive farther afield, to a medical appointment or to visit friends. He grew up in England and he learned to drive in his uncle's car, a De Dion Bouton. "It was something new. Cars were just coming in," Edwards says. "I mean, it was just marvellous." He got his first license in 1925 at age 17. Two years later, he saw a Salvation Army ad seeking young men to work on the farms of England's colonies.</content>

		<title>Gang membership unknown - police</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8762828/Gang-membership-unknown-police</link>
		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>Police have conceded they have little idea just how many gang members are active throughout the country. While believing about 30 adult gangs were active, it was "basically unachievable" to nail down membership numbers, they said in information provided to Fairfax Media. But gang expert and university lecturer Jarrod Gilbert believed police should have an accurate ongoing tally of gang numbers in every centre. "The difference between New Zealand and international gangs . . . is that all of ours self-identify with patches. "You should be able to gain a reasonably accurate idea." Police did an "organised crime survey" in 2004, which revealed there were more than 1600 patched members. Fairfax Media holds a copy of that survey from an Official Information Act request lodged in 2006, but requested another copy, together with all subsequent reports into gang numbers carried out by police in years since. This week, police said the 2004 gang survey did not exist. "In 2003-04 a staff survey was conducted in an attempt to identify all organised crime groups thought to be active in their area . . . This survey was unsuccessful and as a result no statistical data was obtained. "Therefore your request is refused . . . [because] the document you refer to does not exist." However, the police response in 2006 gave specific figures, with no mention of flawed results. And the document certainly exists. The 2004 survey identified five street gangs - the strongest being the Mongrel Mob, followed by Black Power - as well as 34 chapters of various outlaw motorcycle gangs. "The membership of outlaw motorcycle gangs can vary widely, with as few as five patched members and as many as 40 reported," the 2006 police response said. "The average membership is approximately 20 members and does not include numerous associates on the fringes of these groups." Detective Inspector Geoff Scott, at police national headquarters, said police now struggled to monitor the memberships of gangs. "They are making it more difficult for us to track their numbers." Among other difficulties, "there's less inclination for them to wear their patches", he said. The information provided to Fairfax Media says: "The ability to provide definitive numbers in relation to gang membership in New Zealand is . . . problematic. Gang membership . . . is very fluid, with individuals moving into, out of and between gangs on a regular basis. "Many individuals are reluctant to disclose gang affiliations and some individuals deliberately hide their allegiance to a particular gang to avoid attention from law enforcement.</content>

		<title>Unexpected detour for Lindsey Vonn</title>
		<description>Talk about random drugs testing.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/8762600/Unexpected-detour-for-Lindsey-Vonn</link>
		<category>sport/other-sports</category>
		<content>Talk about random drugs testing. Lindsey Vonn took an unexpected detour during her evening at an awards show - off the red carpet and into the women's bathroom for drug testing. The star skier was at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards at Lincoln Center on Monday night when testers from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency escorted her to the restroom to collect a urine sample. The sample was sent to a lab and results weren't immediately available. USADA and Vonn's spokesman confirmed the test. Olympic athletes are subject to random testing and required to fill out forms notifying USADA of their whereabouts at all times. Vonn's spokesman, Lewis Kay, says the test wasn't a big deal to the skier, who wore a deep V-neck white gown by Cynthia Rowley, the designer who accompanied Vonn to the event. "She understands it is part of the job," Kay said in an email Wednesday. The CFDA awards are considered the fashion industry's Oscars. Others attending the black-tie affair included Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jessica Chastain and Ralph Lauren. CFDA organizers, who leave no stone unturned in the planning of their awards show, said they were unaware that Vonn had been tested. USADA said Vonn has participated in its out-of-competition testing pool for more than 12 years. The testing program requires athletes to make themselves available for tests at any time, regardless of location. "We appreciate her professionalism and for accommodating this process, which at times can be inconvenient," USADA spokeswoman Annie Skinner said. Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill at the Vancouver Olympics in 2010. Her 2013 season ended when she injured her knee, though she is expected to return for the 2014 Games in Russia. Most of Vonn's recent headlines, however, have come because she and Tiger Woods revealed they've been dating. They were together at a red-carpet event in New York in May, but Woods was not with Vonn at the event.</content>

		<content>Today's TV weather forecast: Forked lightning with a very chilly snap. Forget reality TV, the bitchiest television show around is not an episode of Real Housewives it's a morning news show in Philadelphia. CBS news anchor Nicole Brewer and meteorologist Carol Erikson give a clinic each morning on passive aggressive news banter, not unlike a scene straight out of href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN-_cZNDy0w" target="_blank">Anchorman: The Legend of Ron A video of their best barbs at each other has gone viral online, and shows what appears to be a clear disdain from the host - a former Miss Pennsylvania - for the weather analyst on the show. But not all is as it seems. CBS vice president of public affairs Joanne Calabria said in a statement the clips had been taken out of context and the two were very close. "Carol and Nicole are professional broadcasters who have great respect for each other and happen to be the closest of colleagues - both inside and outside the office." The two women used their Twitter accounts to try to douse out the claims of animosity. She later added: "Amazing, simply amazing how many people think it is real! But it is better to have this news than some disaster."</content>

		<title>Midwife fails in baby care</title>

		<category>national/health</category>
		<content>A midwife who failed to give a routine Vitamin K dose to a newborn girl, who then had a brain bleed just days after birth, breached healthcare standards, the health and disability commissioner has found. Commissioner Anthony Hill has referred the midwife to the Director of Proceedings, who will decide whether any further action should be taken. She has also been ordered to apologise in writing to the baby, "suitable for her to read when she is sufficiently mature to do so" and to her parents. Hill said the midwife, whose name was not released, breached professional standards and the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights. Babies have low levels of the vitamin in their bodies, and need it to help clot blood and prevent serious bleeding. Without it, they are at risk of getting a rare bleeding disorder which can cause brain damage or death, according to href="http://www.kidshealth.org.nz/vitamin-k" One injection of the vitamin given just after birth will protect the baby for many months. It is the lead maternity carer's responsibility to discuss Vitamin K with the parents. The midwife's client, a 25-year-old nurse, went into labour with her first-born on a Thursday in late 2010. She was told about Vitamin K in antenatal classes, and decided her baby would have the Vitamin K injection, instead of the oral form. The midwife never with the woman before the birth about giving the baby Vitamin and when she talked to the father about it, he passed the decision on to his wife. When the woman was in hospital with her baby, the midwife failed again to talk about the vitamin because she was "incredibly busy". The woman was discharged on Saturday. On Sunday, the midwife visited the family. When the mother asked the midwife about getting Vitamin K, the midwife said she would get it from the hospital. That day, the baby became mildly jaundiced. By Monday night, the baby was "a bit yellow", and not feeding. The mother texted the midwife on Tuesday morning, when the baby was lethargic, not feeding, had "bright yellow jaundice", and had a 10 per cent weight loss since birth. After a screening test, which the midwife took outside the recommended time period, the baby was admitted to hospital. She had a brain haemorrhage, was anaemic and had high sodium levels, and was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit. She had surgery which temporarily removed a bone flap from the skull so blood on the surface of the brain could be removed.</content>

		<title>NZ Police to be slammed with clothing tax</title>
		<description>A bill of over $2 million looms for the New Zealand Police if a retrospective tax is imposed on the plain-clothes officer allowance next</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8835501/NZ-Police-to-be-slammed-with-clothing-tax</link>
		<category>national</category>
		<content>A bill of over $2 million looms for the New Zealand Police if a retrospective tax is imposed on the plain-clothes officer allowance next After a review the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) decided the previously tax-free clothing allowance given to over 2000 police staff who wore plain-clothes would be from July 1. Police are seeking a review of the decision, but in the meantime would foot the bill for any tax liabilities until July 30 this year. While the tax to be paid on the allowances would vary depending on the individual, a Criminal Investigation (CIB) member paid an annual allowance of $1305 and taxed at an assumed rate of 33 per cent would be stung for more than $400. New Zealand Police Association president Greg O'Connor said the tax was an imposition. "We believe it is unfair given all parties believed it was a tax-free allowance. "The rest of their colleagues have their uniform provided, and the requirement for them to be in plain clothes is an imposed cost, so we believe it should be a tax-free benefit, particularly given the nature of the work of these officers." He said normally plain-clothes officers would be in uniform, but the needs of their jobs meant it was not possible. "A lot of it's to do with visiting addresses where they can't be identified as police officers," O'Connor said. "The public is not always appreciative of police in uniform visiting them, particularly victims of crime." He said the total bill could reach $2.3m dollars and it would be up to each individual detective or officer to pay. The association was now working with the IRD to have the bill reviewed and reversed. A senior member of the Palmerston North CIB, Ashley Gurney, said he would be facing a bill of about $4000 if forced to pay a retrospective tax on his clothing allowance. The allowance went toward dry-cleaning bills and buying sensible clothing, Gurney said. "No-one is shopping on Fifth Avenue. [Detectives] recognise the need for durable clothing and only have a limited budget." An IRD spokeswoman said she was unable to comment on an individual taxpayer's situation or on a particular employer's responsibilities for the treatment of allowances due privacy reasons. While there had been no change in tax law, the tax position around allowances, including clothing allowances paid to employees, was complex, she said. It depended on a variety of factors, including the nature of the employment and, in this case, the nature and purpose of the clothing.</content>

		<title>Warrant issued for arrest of rugby star</title>
		<description>The Wallabies' horror second test build-up has sunk to new depths with a warrant issued for the arrest of star winger Digby Ioane.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/international/8835453/Warrant-issued-for-arrest-of-rugby-star</link>
		<category>sport/rugby</category>
		<content>The Wallabies' horror second test build-up has sunk to new depths with a warrant issued for the arrest of star winger Digby Ioane. Ioane is one of five backs in doubt for their biggest home match in 10 years but was training with his Australian teammates when he should have been at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday. The warrant was issued just after 4pm after the 35-test flyer failed to appear to face an unlawful assault charge stemming from an incident in a Prahran pub on March 9. Ioane wasn't charged at the time, but was stood down by the Queensland Reds for one week after details emerged he and his older brother were involved in a scuffle reportedly over an iPhone at the Mount Erica Hotel. The same weekend he was pictured with fellow Wallabies Kurtley Beale, James O'Connor and Quade Cooper, as well as AFL superstar Lance Franklin, sporting gangster poses in a rooftop spa. Victorian police formally charged Ioane on summons on May 17, when the 27-year-old was on tour in South Africa with the Reds. He returned with a knee injury three days later. While the warrant took the Wallabies completely by surprise on Monday, it's an unwanted distraction ahead of their must-win second test against the British and Irish Lions on Saturday night. Nursing a shoulder injury from the 23-21 first Test loss, Ioane was pictured joking with teammates at Carlton's Visy Park before the matter was mentioned briefly in court at 4pm (local time). The end to the day was in contrast to the start when veteran flanker George Smith fronted the media to declare his fitness for a fairytale return to the Wallabies squad. Smith starred as a 20-year-old in the last Lions tour here in 2001, playing a key role as Australia fought back from 1-0 down to claim an historic first series win. If the 110-test great is selected ahead of Liam Gill or Michael Hooper he will become the first player in the professional era to face the Lions is two separate test series. While Brumbies coach Jake White last week dismissed speculation that Smith would be fit to play the second test, the world-class No 7 insisted he was ready to go. "There's no confusion about my fitness or my knee injury or what not because it's not existent any more," he said. Centre Pat McCabe has been given next to no chance of recovering from a worrying neck problem but there's optimism that Christian Lealiifano (head knock), Adam Ashley-Cooper (shoulder) and Ioane can play.</content>

		<title>Nelson Mandela still in critical condition</title>
		<description>Nelson Mandela's condition in a Pretoria hospital remains critical for a second straight day today, says South Africa's president.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/africa/8832973/Nelson-Mandela-still-in-critical-condition</link>
		<category>world/africa</category>
		<content>Nelson Mandela's condition in a Pretoria hospital remains critical for a second straight day today, says South Africa's president. President Jacob described the stricken anti-apartheid hero as being "asleep" when he visited Mandela on Sunday evening (local time). Zuma told at least 60 foreign and South African journalists that doctors were doing everything possible to ensure the 94-year-old's wellbeing and comfort on his 17th day in the hospital. The president repeated some of the content of a presidential statement issued on Sunday and refused to give any details about Mandela's condition, saying: "I'm not a doctor." "Madiba is critical in the hospital, and this is the father of democracy. This is the man who fought and sacrificed his life to stay in prison, the longest-serving prisoner in South Africa. He is one of those who has contributed to democracy," Zuma said, using Mandela's clan name. "All of us in the country should accept the fact that Madiba is now old. As he ages, his health will ... trouble him and I think what we need to do as a country is to pray for him." Zuma, who in the past has given an overly sunny view of Mandela's health, briefly described his visit to the hospital in the capital and seeing Mandela. "It was late, he was already asleep," Zuma said. "And we then had a bit of a discussion with the doctors as well as his wife, Graca Machel, and we left." Mandela, who became South Africa's first black president after the end of apartheid in 1994, was hospitalised on June 8 for what the government said was a recurring lung infection. This is his fourth hospitalisation since December. In Sunday's statement, Zuma also discussed the government's acknowledgement a day earlier that an ambulance carrying Mandela to the Pretoria hospital two weeks ago had engine trouble, requiring the former president to be transferred to another ambulance for his journey. Pretoria, South Africa's capital, lies about 50 kilometres from Johannesburg, where Mandela has been living. "There were seven doctors in the convoy who were in full control of the situation throughout the period. He had expert medical care," Zuma said. "The fully equipped military ICU ambulance had a full complement of specialist medical staff including intensive care specialists and ICU nurses. "The doctors also dismissed the media reports that Madiba suffered cardiac arrest. There is no truth at all in that report." Mandela, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is seen by many around the world as a symbol of peace and reconciliation. He was jailed for 27 years under white racist rule and was released 23 years ago, in 1990. He then played a leading role in steering the divided country from the apartheid era to an all-race democracy, becoming South Africa's first black president in all-race elections in 1994. Zuma appealed to South Africans and the international community to pray for the ailing ex-president, his family and the medical team attending to him.</content>

		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>An Auckland man accused of shooting a person in the head has appeared in court. The 26-year-old appeared in the Auckland District Court today where he was charged with intent to do grievous bodily harm using a firearm. Yesterday, neighbours said they heard a loud argument between two men over a woman in Orakei.It resulted in one of the men running down the road, bleeding from a head wound after he was shot with what is believed to be a BB gun. Neighbours reported hearing shouting and doors slamming followed by screaming as the incident unfolded outside the Kupe St address. Inspector Earl McIntosh called it a "domestic incident" and said the victim ran south down the road, while the alleged offender took off in the other direction, still holding the gun Armed police cleared the address where the shooting took place before working their way up the road in pursuit of the gunman. Several properties of interest were also scoured but the man was not found until four hours later, still in the Orakei area. Police arrested the 26-year-old man and said they were not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident. The victim - a man in his 30s - was given first aid at the scene before being taken to Auckland hospital by ambulance shortly after sustaining the injuries. A DHB spokeswoman said his status was "stable - the lowest of all statuses" and understood the wound had been caused by a BB gun. Witnesses originally told police the weapon looked like an assault rifle. While Orakei is one of the more upmarket suburbs of Auckland, set beside Mission Bay and St Heliers, it contains some state housing and has been the site of some trouble in the past. In 2007 an Auckland businessman told police he was lured to a Kupe St with the promise of a young prostitute before being tied up for seven hours and forced at gunpoint to write a $50,000 personal cheque and make a videoed ''confession'' to being a paedophile. When asked about what the area was like, one neighbour said: "This place is like Otara. You've got people from all different types of gangs living next to each other. Stuff like this is going to happen." The man charged in connection with the shooting will reappear in court later this week.</content>

		<title>Aaron Gilmore coy on comeback</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8834802/Aaron-Gilmore-coy-on-comeback</link>
		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>Former National MP Aaron Gilmore is hinting at a return to politics in the Christchurch East seat to be left vacant by Lianne Dalziel's bid for the mayoralty. On his blog ''Mighty Rocket'' Gilmore, who stood unsuccessfully in the seat in 2008 and 2011, said many locals had asked what he was going to do. ''The answer to that is simple. The by-election is not likely till after Show Week. So good things come to those who wait,'' he said. After being ''hounded out of public office'' he had ''learnt to hold my cards very closely. Bottomline, I do not want to see Labour hold onto the seat as I do not think that is the best thing for the people''. Asked about his interest in the seat, Gilmore, who quit Parliament after allegations around a boozy night out in Hanmer Springs, yesterday said: ''I do not want to talk about it any further at the moment.'' But in his blog he pointed to his family's links to the seat and his working class upbringing. He also argued the seat was not safe for Labour because of the loss of over 12,000 mostly Labour voters since the earthquakes and new housing developments. ''At best they are upper middle swing suburbs,'' he said. ''The biggest populations now are in Parklands, where I grew up, not Aranui.'' National won 13,252 party votes in the seat in 2011 compared to 9100 for Labour. Labour is casting itself as the under dog in the seat, despite Dalziel's 5334 majority in 2011. Gilmore said he hoped Labour would choose someone young and local to try and win. ''They will need to campaign well to try and keep the seat.'' Ngai Tahu manager James Caygill and sitting list MP Clayton Cosgrove are seen as front runners to get the nod for Labour. Caygill yesterday confirmed he would seek the nomination, arguing he represented ''renewal'' for the party. Cosgrove has refused to confirm or deny his interest, and yesterday did not respond to a request for comment. But he is seen as a strong campaigner and is likely to have Shearer's backing.</content>

		<content>Jim Carrey had a change of heart regarding his upcoming movie Kick Ass 2.

		<title>Thai police chase Kiwi's murder accused</title>

		<content>Thai police will seek to extradite the alleged killer of a New Zealand man stabbed to death in Thailand, after he was mysteriously allowed to leave the country while on bail. Former Wellington man Robert Hollick, 43, died after being knifed in the neck during a bar brawl in tourist hotspot Pattaya last August. Thai police arrested and charged Swede Andreas Ringvall with his murder, but he left Thailand last October in unusual circumstances. An investigation by Fairfax Media has revealed: * Ringvall was released on bail after paying 500,000 baht, more than $20,000. Unusually, his passport was returned but Thai Immigration was told not to let him leave the country. After he was granted bail, an unknown person warned the New Zealand embassy that Ringvall would try to flee. Ringvall was granted permission by the Pattaya court to return to Sweden for two weeks in October but never returned. An investigation into his disappearance is under way, as it is not usual for murder suspects to be allowed to leave Thailand. Police Colonel Superintendent Sinard Ajhanwong, head of Thai Interpol, said they would seek to have Ringvall extradited. Sweden typically refused to extradite its citizens but if that proved to be so, Thai police would expect Swedish authorities to press murder charges against Ringvall, he said. "Please can you give [Hollick's] family my sympathies and tell them to please be patient, be calm. "We will make the request. Whether the Swedish authorities will hand him over, we don't know. The main point is it's pretty serious." He said Hollick's family had the right to be upset about the situation. It is understood the Royal Thai Police are investigating why Ringvall was allowed to leave, and given the circumstances that is expected to include whether any bribe was paid to officials. Hollick's mother, Anne Hollick, said she was thrilled to hear Thai authorities would take action. The Upper Hutt woman said it was the first good news she had received since her son's death and she hoped it meant Ringvall would have to face up to his alleged crime. "I don't think of him as a person, quite frankly . . . I only want justice because it's the right thing to do, not only in my case but for everybody." Ajhanwong was involved in another international murder case last December when British kickboxer Lee Aldhouse was extradited back to Thailand after he allegedly stabbed to death United States ex- marine Dashawn Longfellow in Phuket in August 2010, then fled home.</content>

		<title>Daredevil's tightrope walk over canyon</title>
		<description>Nik Wallenda has become the first man to walk across the Grand Canyon on a tightrope - without a safety harness or net.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/8833341/Daredevils-tightrope-walk-over-canyon</link>
		<category>world/americas</category>
		<content>Nik Wallenda has become the first man to walk across the Grand Canyon on a tightrope - without a safety harness or net. The daredevil was greeted with cheers as he crossed the high wire 457 metres above the Little Colorado River Gorge. It was 22 minutes and 54 seconds of pure terror, with the event broadcast live around the world. After he completed the walk, the "King of the High Wire, got on his knees and blew a kiss. "I did it," he said, wiping his eyes and hugging his wife and children. "It was way more windy and the movement of the cable and the side walls as I was walking were getting in the way and confusing," he said afterwards. It had taken "every bit of me to stay focused that entire time. My arms are aching like you wouldn't believe". He added that his mouth was dry. "I feel like I walked in the desert for three weeks, not 20 minutes." The stunt comes a year after Wallenda traversed Niagara Falls earning a seventh Guinness world record. He used the same five-centimetre-thick cable he used to cross the falls. Before stepping out onto the wire he said a prayer. He told reporters before he did the stunt that he would "give my wife and kids a hug and a kiss and tell them I'll see them in a bit". When he stepped onto the high wire, he realised his shoes had dust on them, making them slippery. He repeated "Thank you Jesus" and "Praise you Jesus" during the walk and at one point asked God to help "calm the cable down". Wallenda is a seventh-generation high-wire artist and is part of the famous "Flying Wallendas" circus family - a clan that is no stranger to death-defying feats and great tragedy. His great-grandfather, Karl Wallenda, fell during a performance in Puerto Rico and died at the age of 73. Several other family members, including a cousin and an uncle, have perished while performing wire walking stunts. Nik Wallenda, who was born a year after his great-grandfather died, began wire walking at the age of 2, on a 60cm high stretched rope. He grew up performing with his family and has dreamed of crossing the Grand Canyon since he was a teenager. French high-wire walker Philippe Petit had that same desire and set up a cable above the Little Colorado River, but Navajo officials said he never went through with the stunt and left his equipment there only to be taken down recently by Wallenda's crew. "I don't understand why he didn't," Wallenda said. "It's a site that works, makes sense. He clearly failed at it, so I want to do it successfully." In New Zealand, Wallenda's walk was screened with a 10-second delay on the Discovery Channel. Wallenda was wearing two cameras, one looking down the mostly dry Little Colorado River bed and one facing straight ahead. His leather shoes with an elk-skin sole helped him keep a grip on the steel cable as he moved across.</content>

		<title>Sport concussions hitting ACC hardest</title>
		<description>Sports-related concussions are costing ACC more than million a year, with league playing Maori disproportionately costly, study has found.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/8835085/Sport-concussions-hitting-ACC-hardest</link>
		<category>national/health</category>
		<content>Sports-related concussions are costing ACC more than million a year, with league playing Maori disproportionately costly, study has found. Some 20,902 concussion claims were made in the decade from across seven sporting codes, the study found. The total cost to ACC was said study, published in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport. Moderate to serious concussions accounted for just 6.4 per cent claims (1330) but 79.1 per cent of the total cost ($13,039,416). A moderate to serious involved a combination of medical care, rehabilitation costs income replacement for employment time lost as a result of the injury. Of concern was the damage done to league players. They made significantly fewer moderate to serious claims than union players (179 to 802), but cost on average $25,545 concussion, when the figure for rugby was $7797. It suggested head injuries sustained in rugby league were more and took longer to recover from. Maori league players were particularly affected, with a mean cost $43,604 per concussion, almost double any other ethnicity per sport. "This may be reflective of the nature of rugby league when with rugby union or the management of these types of injuries," study said. It pointed to other studies which found rugby league had a higher of tackles involving contact to the head than rugby union (89.9 1000 tackles compared to 0.6 per 1000 in rugby union). Despite that, rugby union had four times more reported moderate serious concussions than rugby league but the study suggested was an issue with league under-reporting concussions. "The overall knowledge level of concussion identification management was only 42 per cent for rugby league team coaches and trainers New Zealand," the study said. Age was also a determining factor in cost, as the 30-39-year-old group registered the highest mean cost ($19,910 per concussion). The study suggests this is because earnings-related claims are greater in this age group compared with lower younger players. The worst concussions come from when people continue to play being concussed, so the study suggests a wider understanding concussion identification is required to remove players from play the first sign of concussion.</content>

		<category>national</category>
		<content>An elderly Paekakariki couple, prominent in the local community, signed a suicide pact before ending their lives together, a Coroners Court has found. Adrian and Marei Webster were found lying side-by-side by family in their Ames St home in the Kapiti town in March last year. In his findings from the inquest into the cause of death released this morning Wellington coroner Garry Evans found the couple were parties to a suicide pact. Evans said it was desirable the "true facts surrounding the couple's deaths should be made known as it attracted widespread media coverage at the time". Evans however suppressed all information as to the mode of death concluding there "should be no legitimate interest from the public in the manner in which the couple met their deaths". A number of notes were found by family alluding to suicide after the bodies were discovered by family Evans said. The couple, both aged in their 70s, were described as "giants of the community". Both were active in local politics. Adrian Webster was the Paekakariki Community Board chairman. He had been diagnosed with stomach cancer and unbeknown to his family, had been given only months to live. His wife Marei Bollinger-Webster was described by friends as his "loyal lieutenant, confidant and friend". Before her death Mrs Webster had said to friends she would be unable to live without her husband.

		<title>Australia sack coach ahead of Ashes series</title>
		<description>Cricket Australia has sacked head coach Mickey Arthur on the eve of the Ashes.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/8834405/Australia-sack-coach-ahead-of-Ashes-series</link>
		<category>sport/cricket</category>
		<content>Cricket Australia has sacked head coach Mickey Arthur on the eve of the Ashes. The former South Africa coach, whose contract was due to run until the end of the World Cup in March 2015, was informed of the decision over the weekend. It is expected that he will be replaced by highly rated Queensland coach Darren Lehmann who is in England and has just completed a coaching stint with Australia A. Arthur came in for heavy criticism for his role in standing down four players, including then vice-captain Shane Watson, during the Test tour of India in March for failing to complete performance feedback on time. There has been a school of thought that the South African was not tough enough to oversee the generational change in the Australian team, and he has been made responsible for a team culture that has gone backwards this year. The latest examples were David Warner's twin run-ins with trouble - first on Twitter, then in a bar in Birmingham - which led to the opener being suspended until the first Test at Trent Bridge. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland was furious at Warner's conduct and understood to be also angry at the handling of the bar-room affair - in which Warner punched England's Joe Root - by team management. The decision comes as all of Australia's squad converges for the first time in Taunton in England on Monday, for their first pre-Ashes tour match, against Somerset beginning on Wednesday. Arthur was one of the major appointments in the aftermath of the Argus Review, which was ordered after Australia lost the 2009-10 home Ashes series to England. He was then coaching Western Australia but was selected after a worldwide search for the newly created head coach and selector position - former coach Tim Nielsen did not apply for it - on a three-and-a-half-year contract. Lehmann has proved popular as a batting coach of Australia A and in his trophy-winning stint in Queensland. The 43-year-old, renowned as a shrewd thinker during his playing career of 27 Tests and 117 one-day internationals, has won the Sheffield Shield and one-day titles with the Bulls while also steering Brisbane Heat to the Big Bash League title. Lehmann has also coached in the Indian Premier League with Kings XI Punjab and the defunct Deccan Chargers.</content>

		<title>Man found guilty of rape, abduction</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8834544/Man-found-guilty-of-rape-abduction</link>
		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>A jury has found Michael Shane Lihou guilty of raping and abducting a teenager in the small Wairarapa town of Carterton almost a year ago. It is the third time he has been found guilty of detaining women. Two of them were raped. In the High Court at Wellington during his latest trial, which started last week, the jury heard evidence about the earlier crimes. The jury was told that in 1998 Lihou had abducted and raped a Christchurch teenager who he was infatuated with. She was taken into the Canterbury countryside and Lihou broke into farm buildings and took a vehicle over several days before he was caught, and she was rescued, near Kaikoura. In 1996 he twice kidnapped a woman who he had met in prison the year before. She had sponsored his parole but he turned on her when she wanted him out of her house due to his aggressive behaviour. In the latest incident Lihou, 44, "employed" a vulnerable teenager. In evidence last week the complainant, now 18, said she had met Lihou through mutual friends and he asked her if she wanted to be his "personal assistant". Lihou was on a benefit, doing odd jobs for people, and helping build a shed on the property where he lived under the wing of an elderly couple who helped ex-prisoners. The incident in July last year occurred two days after Lihou had moved into a room in the shed. Lihou said he was writing a book about his life and needed the teenager's computer skills. However, the teenager seemed less clear about the book project. She said he would ask her to go places with him, and send texts and emails for him. He also asked her to number more than 400 pages of documents. The documents included police and court papers from which she agreed she found out what Lihou had been in prison for in the past. She denied knowing he was supposed to have taken one of the victims into the countryside. Lihou said the teenager had been willing sex partner who agreed to walk with him for about 8 kilometres to a farm where he said a friend worked part time. She said he insisted on her drinking alcohol and assaulted her to stop her leaving and to facilitate the sexual offences. She said he stopped her using her cellphone and ended up throwing it in a creek. He said the phone fell into the creek accidentally. Police found them on a farm nearly 24 hours after the girl had gone to the shed hoping that Lihou would pay her the money she believed she was owed. Lihou said he did not owe her money and she had come to his house for a "session".</content>

		<title>Oversight led to net-roller death - coroner</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8834467/Oversight-led-to-net-roller-death-coroner</link>
		<category>national</category>
		<content>A Nelson vineyard manager made a tragic safety oversight which led to him being fatally pulled through an automatic net roller, a coroner's inquiry has found. In a finding released today Coroner Carla na Nagara said David Jon McIntosh died from massive blunt force head trauma in April 2010 after the NetWizz net roller he was working on unexpectedly re-started, dragging him in. McIntosh would normally turn the tractor hydraulics off or disengage the spindle motor when working on the net but on this occasion he did not, na Nagara said. Instead he relied on a net sensor to stop the net being pulled in but this did not fully engage and the machine re-started, trapping McIntosh's leg in the process. Na Nagara said McIntosh was known to be a conscientious and methodical worker who was proficient and experienced in the safe operation of the NetWizz. "For reasons that can not be established, on the day of the accident he did not disengage the spindle motor before working on the net, an oversight that had tragic consequences." The issue with the sensor not fully engaging has been raised with the machine's importer to try and remove the potential for future false operation. The manufacturer has also updated the machine's safety manual so that the operator is advised to disengage the spindle motor before tucking in the end of the net.</content>

		<title>Bugatti Veyron tipped for 1500hp farewell fling</title>
		<description>Bugatti is being tipped to give the Veyron a 1500 horsepower farewell fling.</description>

		<category>motoring</category>
		<content>Bugatti is being tipped to give the Veyron a 1500 horsepower farewell fling. While Bugatti is currently planning a replacement for the Veyron motoring publications href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/concept-cars/new-%C2%A35m-bugatti-veyron-planned" and href="http://carbuzz.com/news/2013/6/23/Grand-Finale-1500HP-Bugatti-Veyron-is-Coming-7714947/" have both reported in the past few days about a new extreme version of the road-going rocket that could be launched as early as next year. Official Bugatti confirmation of such a beast appears scarce with Autocar quoting a company insider as saying it wanted to produce a Veyron that was "a fantasy in terms of its performance". ''We are looking at several options,'' the insider said. "The reality is that we are not under time pressure because we are confident of selling out the full Veyron production run regardless. ''Only after that can we see if there is time and appetite for such a programme. It would be expensive and time-consuming, so we must be sure it is worth The Veyron's quad-turbo W16 engine currently pushes out 1184 horses but its potential is said to be closer to 1500hp. That combined with a more extensive use of carbon fibre, which could cut up to 200 kilograms from its kerb weight, could see a 1500hp Veyron with a top speed in the 450kmh range. The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport currently holds the world record for the fastest production car at 431.072kmh. Any shot that the 450kmh mark, however, would only be possible if an improvement in tyre technology - to stop them melting at such high speeds - is available. And the projected cost of such a supercar? A mind boggling NZ$9.9 million.</content>

		<title>Entertainer jailed for sexual violation</title>

		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>A Hawke's Bay entertainer has been jailed after he lured a teenager to his house for a modelling shoot and sexually violated him. The 43-year-old was found guilty of violating the 17-year-old seven years ago, following a three-day trial in the Napier District Court last month. Judge Raoul Neave sentenced the man to three years, one month imprisonment today. He extended name suppression because he believed publication could harm the man's family. During the trial, the court heard that the man approached a teenager in a video store about modelling for him. The teen said he reluctantly agreed to go to his house because he promised to pay him and he needed the money for school. He began posing for the photo shoot fully-clothed but, as it progressed, the man asked him to remove his shirt and trousers. He also got him to change out of his boxer shorts into white underwear. The man rubbed body oil all over the teen, claiming it would improve the photos. He then performed a sex act on him. The man's 10-year-old daughter was watching television in a nearby room while this was happening. The man, who is bisexual, said he never intended the photo shoot to culminate in a sexual encounter, he told police he was "like a red rag to a bull" when he noticed the teen's arousal. He believed the teen was consenting because he did not stop him. The complainant, who is now 23, said he "just froze". Afterward he became angry and told the man it "wasn't cool". During sentencing, Judge Neave said the man's "monumental lack of judgement" resulted in his fall from grace. Lawyer Roger Philip said his client had given a lot to the community through his work, performing and hosting community events. Mr Philip described it as one-off opportunistic offending. Judge Neave said the man never thought about whether the teen was consenting. "He metaphorically dived in." The offending had a major impact on the victim, who did not like having his photo taken because it brought back bad memories. Judge Neave said the man showed no remorse. "You simply failed to see what you were doing was wrong."</content>

		<title>Vigilante's sentence appeal rejected</title>

		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>He administered a violent dose of vigilante justice to a sex offender - including attempted strangulation with a noose - but a Feilding mechanic now says his own jail sentence is too harsh. Grayson Weaver, 41, is serving a 4-year, 7-month prison term for the violent assault on Peter Ivan Potroz, 64, at his Feilding home on August 1, 2010. Weaver and his partner Katrina Maree Uncles, 42, of Paraparaumu, received identical sentences in May 2011 after both admitted one charge each of aggravated burglary and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to injure. Last year Uncles successfully appealed her jail term and the Court of Appeal reduced it to three years and eight months, ruling that the sentencing judge failed to take her fragile mental state into account. Uncles had formed the belief that Potroz had been having sexual contact with her son, although no formal allegations were made, and said a "spirit" told her to attack Potroz. Weaver argued he, too, should have received a discount for mental illness, although the Court of Appeal did not agree and in a judgment released this month upheld his sentence. Weaver maintained he was not totally responsible for his actions because he was sexually offended against by a man when he was young and had suffered a mental disorder since. The court also rejected a claim that the sentencing judge's calculations began from an excessive starting point and relied on "aggravating facts" that Weaver did not admit, including a victim statement from Potroz that overstated his injuries. "The court accepted that [Uncles'] discount would create a disparity between her sentence and that of Weaver, but considered that to be justified because the evidence as to her serious mental disorder was clear and Weaver was not under any equivalent disability," the Court of Appeal judgment says. On the night of the attack Potroz was woken by knocking at his door, and he recognised Uncles' voice. Potroz's door was kicked in as he tried to ring the police and Uncles came into his bedroom. Potroz hit her with "a back hand" and Uncles yelled to Weaver for help. Weaver punched Potroz in the face, and Potroz fell against a tallboy before hitting the ground. He got to his hands and knees before Weaver landed four more blows to the head. A noose was then placed around Potroz's neck and tightened. Potroz pretended to pass out, but the strangulation continued. As he was on the verge of losing consciousness for real, the noose was released and Potroz heard footsteps running away.</content>

		<title>Caregiver's fight for payment to get court hearing</title>
		<description>Nasty emails between government staff likening a Down Syndrome man to a "tatty teddy bear" are likely to be defended in court today as part of a case about paying family caregivers of the disabled.</description>

		<category>national</category>
		<content>Nasty emails between government staff likening a Down Syndrome man to a "tatty teddy bear" are likely to be defended in court today as part of a case about paying family caregivers of the disabled. Mother Margaret Spencer has been battling the Government to try get financial help to help her support her 44-year-old son, Paul, for 10 years. She has looked after him since birth. Their fight is now being played out in the High Court at Auckland, where Spencer has taken a judicial review of a court decision ruling caregivers must be paid because the Ministry of Health still refused to give her any money. She said she is not only fighting for herself, but many others in the same situation. Yesterday the court heard from Spencer's lawyer Jim Farmer, who said his client believed the case was about democratic rights. He said there were "many shocking aspects" to the case. These included the Government's decision to ignore court rulings, to take away the right to recompense and the ouster condition in a new "discriminatory" law passed on family caregivers - which allows minimum wages for 40 hours per week - preventing challenges to the law. "But there is also a human element," he said, and then read a statement from Spencer in which she said she was "driven by emotion" and preventing injustice. I stand here for democracy," the statement said. "And this is not a democracy as a democracy ensures equality of rights. This is a dictatorship where the Government is trying to gag the courts." Farmer said the case was highly emotive, and read out examples of the nastiness between the Government and Spencer, including an email between Ministry of Social Development staff following a hearing where Spencer lost the right to a benefit. "She really laid the sympathy vote right on, dragging poor Paul around like a tatty teddy bear, telling the committee what a martyr she was," the email read. "She totally believed that by going to the minister she had made a difference and I was pleased to see that the decision withstood the scrutiny of the minister." Farmer also noted the health ministry's contradictory stance - paying some caregivers but not others - and its widely varying figures. He the ministry had estimated the cost of paying family caregivers between $17 million and $593m. However evidence from an economist suggested the cost to be between $32m and $64m. The court also heard from the Human Rights Commission yesterday. Lawyers for the Attorney-General are expected to put their defence today. The case is set to go for three days before chief High Court judge Justice Helen Winkelmann.</content>

		<title>The man who trades on tragedy</title>
		<description>An Indonesian former policeman turned people smuggler has been caught on a hidden camera referring to asylum seekers as ''goats'' and boasting of how he bribed police to turn a blind eye to his operation.</description>

		<category>world/asia</category>
		<content>An Indonesian former policeman turned people smuggler has been caught on a hidden camera referring to asylum seekers as ''goats'' and boasting of how he bribed police to turn a blind eye to his operation. The man, Freddy Ambon, is one of Indonesia's most active people smugglers, and boasts of sending multiple boats per month to Christmas Island, charging refugees between A$5000 and A$6000 for the journey. He also talks about a boat he helped arrange last year which sank, killing 96 people. The tragedy prompted a fierce parliamentary debate in Australia, and ultimately forced Labor to reverse its position and reopen Nauru and Manus Island detention centres. Ambon revealed a change in the tactics of his syndicate since the tragic sinking last June. . "To me, honestly, I don't mind taking small numbers. The important thing, thank god, is that the journey goes smoothly ... if there were three departures in one month I'd thank god - 50 people in the first batch, 50 in the second batch, 50 in the third batch, that adds up to 150 people, right?" The video was recorded in a Jakarta apartment in May by a man posing as someone who could bring Afghan refugees to sail on Ambon's boats. Fairfax Media and the ABC obtained the video in a joint investigation. The man who recorded it is now believed to have left Indonesia. Ambon, who attended the meeting with his wife, daughter-in-law and granddaughter, describes himself as the operations manager of a syndicate run by a Pakistani smuggler known as Billu. He says he is paid a wage by Billu, whose real name is Javed Mehmud Bhat. Bhat has since been arrested. "He's the boss, he's the owner, and I was the one who ran the business ... without me he could do nothing," Ambon says. "I am an expert at this job ... everybody knows". "We've been in the business for years," Ambon's wife adds. Ambon says he buys the boat from a man in the north Jakarta suburb of Muara Angke, and then has the engines overhauled and fuel loaded. The boat is then sailed empty to a beach called Labuhan, near Pandeglang in West Java. The refugees are picked up from a suburb of north Jakarta and taken to Ancol Beach marina. The police do not stop them. "It's ... guarded by police, my police, my men," Ambon says. The head of Ancol police post, first inspector Sulistyo Yudo Pangestu, denied that any illegal migrants had been captured at Ancol and said he had never heard of Freddy Ambon. The refugees take another boat from Ancol to Labuhan, near Pandeglang, where the police also make no arrests: "The police chief is like 'this' with me ... and the police headquarters will escort the boat," Ambon says. "I'm a former policeman it means there is no problem, bro ... The passengers will get through." Indonesian police spokesman senior commissioner Agus Riyanto said the story about corruption at Pandeglang was "not true, there is nothing like that". But in Indonesia, the code word for bribery is often "co-ordination" and, Ambon says, unsuccessful people smugglers neglect this.</content>

		<title>Silvio Berlusconi sentenced to jail</title>
		<description>A Milan court has sentenced Italian former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to seven years in prison after convicting him of paying for sex with a minor - but he will not have to serve any jail time before he has exhausted appeals.</description>

		<category>world/europe</category>
		<content>A Milan court has sentenced Italian former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to seven years in prison after convicting him of paying for sex with a minor - but he will not have to serve any jail time before he has exhausted appeals. With two appeals possible, it could be years before a verdict is final and Berlusconi lawyers announced they would file an appeal against what his counsel Niccolo Ghedini called a "completely illogical" />The verdict against the flamboyant 76-year-old media tycoon added to the complications facing Prime Minister Enrico Letta, whose fragile left-right coalition is supported by Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party. Berlusconi was found guilty of paying for sex with former teenage nightclub dancer Karima El Mahroug, better known under her stage name "Ruby the Heartstealer", during alleged "bunga bunga" sex parties at his palatial home near Milan. The panel of three judges, all women, also convicted him of abuse of office by arranging to have El Mahroug released from police custody when she was detained in a separate theft case. As a result, the judges banned Berlusconi from public office. The verdict closes a two-year trial that has mesmerised Italy with its accounts of "bunga bunga" parties at the billionaire's private villa outside Milan while he was premier in 2010. Several PDL members have urged Berlusconi to withdraw his backing for the government, and he may be more tempted to do so if he decides it is giving him no legal protection. "It's disgusting, a disgrace," one of his most faithful lieutenants, senior party official Daniela Santanche, told reporters in front of the Milan court. But she said it would not impact the functioning of the government. "We want this government to act to do the things Italians need, so this ruling has nothing to do with the ruling." Berlusconi always denied wrongdoing and says he is being persecuted by left-wing prosecutors. He says the purported sex parties were elegant dinners where the female guests performed "burlesque" shows. El Mahroug denies having sex with Berlusconi.</content>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/8837407/Star-leaves-Warriors-with-immediate-effect</link>
		<category>sport/league</category>
		<content>Bill Tupou has left the Warriors with immediate effect and has signed for the Canberra Raiders. The 22-year-old winger has played 62 games for the Warriors since making his debut against the Sea Eagles in round four of the 2010 season, but will leave the club on a two and a half year deal with the Raiders. Last year Tupou signed a new deal with the Warriors for this season and next, plus an option for the 2015 campaign with the Auckland side. He was a regular starter in the early part of the season but hasn't played first grade since round 10, with Warriors coach Matt Elliott preferring Glen Fisiiahi or Ngani Laumape ahead of him. The Warriors agreed to give him an early release to his contract and both the Raiders and Eels were quick to offer him a contract. Both options were of interest. Eels coach Ricky Stuart is rebuilding his Eels side for next season and Tupou would have been a key part of that, but at the Raiders he'll go into a team that's already competitive and looking good for a place in the top eight this season. With the Raiders' big wing Edrick Lee not due back until round 24 because of a broken arm, Tupou is likely to be rushed straight into their starting team and may even play for them against the Rabbitohs on Friday night if the registration paperwork is completed at the NRL in time. Tupou needs game time to increase his chances of making it into the Kiwis World Cup squad later this year. The former Junior Kiwi had been with the Warriors throughout his career. In 2008 he scored 14 tries in 19 games in the newly formed Toyota Cup and scored the same number of tries in two fewer games the following campaign. He leaves the Warriors with a record of scoring 19 tries in 62 games.</content>

		<content>New Zealand landmarks could be in for a colourful change when the royal baby is born. If Monarchy New Zealand have their way landmarks could be ablaze of blue or pink when the baby arrives on July 13. They are in talks with the controlling authorities of several landmarks to light them in celebration of the birth of a royal boy or girl. Monarchy New Zealand chair Sean Palmer could not confirm what landmarks were being lined up as talks were ongoing. There are the obvious choices like the Sky Tower and Beehive, but what are some of the other alternatives? Tirau's corrugated iron sheep and dog could do with a bit of livening up and the Rotorua geyser could be transformed into the Las Vegas Bellagio fountains with a splash of colour. What do you think? Northland- Tane Mahuta Auckland - Sky Tower Waikato - Tirau corrugated iron sheep and dog Bay of Plenty - Rotorua geyser Hawke's Bay - Pania of the reef Rangitikei-Manawatu - Ohakune carrot Taranaki - Mt Egmont/Taranaki Wellington - Beehive Nelson - Boulder bank lighthouse West Coast - Punakaiki pancake rocks Canterbury- Aoraki/Mt Cook Christchurch - Remnants of Christchurch Cathedral Central Otago - The Remarkables Dunedin - The Octagon Southland- Gore salmon</content>

		<title>Air NZ reveals Dreamliner routes</title>

		<content>The key long haul destinations for Air New Zealand's new fleet of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft will be Shanghai and Tokyo, the national carrier has announced. The new generation planes will also service some mid-haul destinations such as Perth, Honolulu and Papeete, the airline said. Air New Zealand is the launch-customer for the 787-9, the stretch version of Boeing's Dreamliner. The first 787-9 is due to roll off the production line at Boeing's Seattle plant next month. Air New Zealand chief executive officer Christopher Luxon said the 787-9 was a game-changer for the airline. "This modern flexible fuel-efficient aircraft will not only replace our current fleet of Boeing 767s, it also represents a significant growth opportunity for our business and opens up the prospect of expanding our Pacific Rim footprint. "Given our 787-9s will be multiple-purpose aircraft - operating both long and mid haul sectors - we've put a lot of research effort into coming up with four distinct seating selections that meet the customer expectations across the markets it will serve," he said. The business premier cabin will feature Air New Zealand's chalk coloured leather armchair which converts to a lie-flat bed. In premium economy the airline has worked with US seat designer Zodiac on a customised seat described as "business-lite". The economy cabin will have 16 rows of Air New Zealand's Kiwi-designed Skycouch seats. This is a row of three seats that convert into a sofa-like flat surface, sometimes nicknamed "cuddle class". The standard Economy seat in the 787-9 will be also be supplied by US manufacturer Zodiac and customised to Air New Zealand's specifications. Luxon said the addition of the 787-9 to the Air New Zealand fleet meant the airline would be able to offer a consistent product across its long-haul fleet, and would see the Skycouch available on routes into Asia for the first time. The 787-8 was grounded for three months this year by the Federal Aviation Authority and other international authorities, but has returned to service. Air New Zealand said last month that it had confidence in Boeing to deliver the 787-9 on time and with any safety issues fixed. It expects the first of its 10 new aircraft to begin operating on its international network from mid-2014, with the rest in operation over the following three years.</content>

		<content>A weather presenter on Canadian television network Global TV lost her composure when a spider crawled across the screen showing the city. Kristi Gordon ducks to escape as the much-larger-than-life critter enters the screen just above her head. "Oh my gosh, that was creepy," Gordon says as she runs across the set until part of her body disappears. "Of course he had to be right on my head." She shrieks and laughs as she ducks and weaves, and then walks out of the picture. "I hate it. I can't stand it," her disembodied voice says. Other members of the crew enjoy the disturbance, and one points out: "Kristi it's not in the room, it's okay." "It just really creeps me out," Gordon says recovering her composure. On Twitter she noted: "Embarrassingly not the first time freaked out by spiders, bugs, snakes and Halloween." Global TV has even posted video of a few of Gordon's other uncomfortable moments.</content>

		<title>The $4 op shop surprise</title>
		<description>You know the story the op shop bargain that sells for a fortune.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/oddstuff/8838226/The-4-op-shop-surprise</link>
		<category>oddstuff</category>
		<content>You know the story the op shop bargain that sells for a fortune. Sometimes you doubt that this ever really happens but it did at an auction in Melbourne last week when Sotheby's Australia sold a 17th century Chinese "libation cup" carved from rhinoceros horn for A$75,640 (NZ$90,255). And yes, this rare object really was discovered in a Sydney op shop and bought for A$4 (NZ$4.77). The seller, who wanted to remain anonymous, does the rounds of the local op shops and when he saw this on the shelf he thought, well, that looks a bit special. After doing some research he sent photos to Sotheby's consultant Ann Roberts, a specialist in Asian Art, who confirmed that it was indeed rare and valuable. Despite a large chip, she gave it a pre-sale estimate of A$20,000 to />The winning bid, more than double the higher estimate, came as no surprise to her. Similar objects have sold for close to A$90,000 in Australia, and as much as A$200,000 overseas. Roberts phoned the vendor to tell him the results. "He was very pleased," she said. Finding one in an op shop is not to be expected, although she said she wasn't surprised that they had given it such a token value. "They don't look immediately attractive to the untrained eye," she said. Sotheby's won't identify the buyer of the rhino horn cup. These were especially prized by Asian collectors, although objects made from materials such as ivory and rhinoceros horn, even ones that are more than 300 years old, are subject to a CITES licensing restrictions before they can be sent overseas. This story, impressive as it is, pales into insignificance when compared with the Chinese 'Ding' bowl which sold for US$2.225 million (NZ$2.866m) at a Sotheby's New York auction in March. The sellers had picked it for less than US$3 at a neighbourhood tag sale in 2007. They were unaware of its potential value.</content>

		<title>David Tua shaping up for do-or-die clash</title>
		<description>David Tua has crowned himself a "giant killer" ahead of his do-or-die boxing clash in Hamilton with two-metre tall Russian Alexander Ustinov.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/8835204/David-Tua-shaping-up-for-do-or-die-clash</link>
		<category>sport/other-sports</category>
		<content>David Tua has crowned himself a "giant killer" ahead of his do-or-die boxing clash in Hamilton with two-metre tall Russian Alexander Ustinov. Tua has been studying videos of his opponent and has already identified weaknesses that he will seek to exploit when they meet in the ring at Hamilton's Claudelands Arena on August 31. The event is called David v Goliath, and in an exclusive interview Tua, 40, said he would have to become boxing's "giant killer" and win by knockout in order to make a statement. "I'm going for a good win. If that opportunity opens up I'm going to take it. Absolutely," he said. "I've seen him fight. There's always holes and everything. I think there's a few there I can pick up." Ustinov stands 2.02 metres tall and weighs 136 kilograms, compared to Tua's 1.78 metres and most recent fight weight of 110.8kg. But in his latest fights the Russian - who has 27 wins, 21 by knockout and one loss - has been sluggish and he holds his hands low, providing plenty of openings for Tua to target if he comes into the ring in better mental and physical shape than his last appearance in August 2011. At his Onehunga gym yesterday, Tua was already looking much slimmer and more toned than he was six months ago. There's still plenty of flab hanging off his torso, but his shoulders are taking shape and his legs, his main source of power, are morphing into thick muscle. "Not bad for an old fella," he said, flexing his arms. Tua's said to have lost more than 20kg over the past six months and he credits a return of trainer Lee Parore, who got him in the best shape of his career for his fight against Shane Cameron in 2009, for his drastic transformation. "I got killed for the first week, but no matter what he put out there I'd always come back," Tua said. "I need to stay on top to get myself in the best possible shape so I can give myself the best possible chance in this fight. "It's ugly, absolutely ugly, man. It's terrible. There isn't any happy, great thought that crosses my mind when I train because I get killed every day. "Some days I die three times, four times." He's said to be training two times a day, six days a week with Parore and has also cleaned up his diet, which means no more Burger King. "The most important thing is not to stay focused on the weight, but it's the feeling, because you can lose weight and not feel good." He said he turned up unprepared for his last fight with Barrett, a mistake he has no plans of repeating. "If I'm willing to take care of what I need to do ... I really believe the rest will take care of itself."</content>

		<title>Casino trying face recognition technology</title>

		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8837356/Casino-trying-face-recognition-technology</link>
		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>Facial-recognition technology will be trialled at Auckland's SkyCity Casino in a bid to stop problem gambling. The system is part of a concession deal between Auckland mayor Len Brown and the casino ahead of its planned expansion. The government has granted SkyCity the right to add almost 500 extra gambling machines in exchange for building and running the $400 million convention centre. The facial-recognition system has been used in Canada and identifies problem gamblers who ban themselves, or who have been banned. It has been likened to the SmartGate system at New Zealand airports, where all passengers' faces are scanned and compared to a wider database of images. Brown said if successful, the system could be rolled out across all pokies in bars and clubs in Auckland in a bid to cut problem gambling. "The potential is here for it to be a real breakthrough for problem gamblers," Brown said. "This is to deal with those who are seriously addicted and who are endangering the financial well being of their families." The SkyCity convention centre deal will be signed by this Sunday. It also includes an extension to the casino's exclusive Auckland licence and allowances for easier ways of transferring money in the casino. In a statement, SkyCity said it was committed to providing the safest possible environment for its customers. "Our harm-minimisation programme is already the most comprehensive of any gambling operator in New Zealand," it said. "Nevertheless, we are committed to continuous improvement of our programme that will ensure we are always at the leading edge of harm minimisation." It said it was committed to trialling the new technology.</content>

		<title>Dunne pressured over controversial spy bill</title>

		<category>national/politics</category>
		<content>Prime Minister John Key is heaping pressure on Peter Dunne to vote for controversial spy legislation, as he scrambles to build Parliamentary support for the controversial bill. The Government is working on legislation to extend the powers of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) to spy on New Zealanders, although Key maintains this simply formalises what has been happening for years. With the Maori Party indicating it will not vote for the legislation, it will almost certainly rely on the support of Dunne or NZ First. Dunne has expressed deep reservations about the bill, saying he wants a ''very clear boundary'' between the Security Intelligence Service (SIS), which focuses on domestic surveillance, and the GCSB, which focuses on foreign threats. The GCSB should not spy on New Zealanders ''under any circumstances'', Dunne said. But Key said this morning that he was ''extremely confident'' that Dunne, a Government partner, would vote for the bill. ''He knows the value of national security and he knows that we actually do need to clarify the law to allow assistance to be provided to the likes of the SIS and the police,'' Key told TV3's Firstline this morning. ''This is not a debate about whether a particular New Zealander will have intelligence gathered about them and about their activities. That will happen. The question is whether SIS do it or GCSB do it under a warrant provided by SIS as an assisting agent.'' The Government is prepared to work with New Zealand First on the bill, but Key said it was not unusual for National to work with the party. NZ First leader Winston Peters has said that there has been a lack of analysis done on the bill, and that greater safeguards need to be put in place to monitor the GCSB. Meanwhile Key indicated it was only the influence of Grant Robertson, Labour's deputy leader, stopping that party supporting the bill. ''Labour have got themselves in a bit of a terrible bind. They actually know that they need to vote for this legislation, they know it's increasing the oversight, but Grant Robertson's sort of running the ship around there. He's just playing politics with it and [David] Shearer's been rolled over by Robertson and that's the problem.'' Yesterday Key warned the surveillance capabilities of police, the SIS and Defence Force would be beefed up if controversial spy legislation falls That would be at "significant cost", Key warned.</content>

		<title>Nadal out in Wimbledon shocker</title>

		<category>sport/tennis</category>
		<content>Lightning struck twice for Rafa Nadal at Wimbledon as the Spanish 12-times grand-slam champion suffered a shock first-round defeat by Belgian outsider Steve Darcis on Monday. A year after losing to Czech Lukas Rosol in the second round, Nadal was outplayed by the 135th-ranked Darcis on Court One, losing 7-6(4) 7-6(8) 6-4 in front of a disbelieving crowd. Fifth seed Nadal, who had never lost in the first round of a grand-slam tournament before, appeared to be struggling physically at times but refused to make excuses. "I tried my best out there in every moment. It was not possible for me," Nadal, playing on grass for the first time this season, told a news conference. "It is not a tragedy." Nadal, who spent seven months out of action with a knee injury after last year's Wimbledon defeat, served for the second set but Darcis hit back to move two sets in front. Asked if his knee had been giving him problems, Nadal said: "I don't want to talk about my knee this afternoon. Anything that I would say today about my knee would be an excuse. The only thing I can say is to congratulate Steve Darcis." As the clock crept towards three hours on court, Nadal's touch deserted him completely and he turned his back on the court, grimacing, after failing to cash in a breakpoint in the eighth game and hitting a feeble forehand into the net. DARCIS'S DELIGHT As he served for the match at 5-4, Darcis, sensing blood, put himself ahead with a superb running forehand after chasing the ball across court. Finding himself right in front of the press photographers, he obligingly pumped his fist and roared with delight. Another Nadal forehand error gave Darcis matchpoint and he finished off the biggest win of his career with an ace. "You don't beat Nadal if he isn't playing his best tennis," said Darcis, a no-nonsense player who trudged out from every changeover with his towel clenched between his teeth and his head bowed in thought. "It is my biggest win so I have to be happy. Maybe he was not in the best shape ever but I have to be proud of me," he told a news conference. The man nicknamed "The Shark", after a tattoo he sports on his right shoulder, dropped 22 places in the rankings coming into Wimbledon and said his career had often been blighted by injury.</content>

		<title>Man arrested over French Alps killings</title>
		<description>The brother of a British-Iraqi man shot to death with three other people last year in a remote area of the French Alps has been arrested after investigators gathered evidence that the siblings were fighting over their father's inheritance.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/8837022/Man-arrested-over-French-Alps-killings</link>
		<category>world/europe</category>
		<content>The brother of a British-Iraqi man shot to death with three other people last year in a remote area of the French Alps has been arrested after investigators gathered evidence that the siblings were fighting over their father's inheritance. Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor in the town of Annecy, identified the man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder as Zaid al-Hilli. He said the arrest, which British police confirmed took place in Chessington on the outskirts of London, did not necessarily mean the killer was in custody. However, Maillaud said there was strong evidence that a dispute over the father's inheritance had boiled over and noted that Saad al-Hilli had multiple copies of two versions of the will: one that split the inheritance between the two brothers and one that left everything to Zaid. Maillaud said one of the copies was found in the camper in France. "We've known for a long time that there was a conflict between the brothers," he said. Saad al-Hilli, his wife, an elderly relative and a cyclist were killed in the attack near Annecy last September but the couple's two young daughters survived, including one who spent about eight hours huddled beneath her mother's lifeless body before help arrived. Her older sister, then 7 years old, was shot in the shoulder and severely beaten. All four people killed suffered two bullets to the head among other wounds. The bodies were discovered by a British cyclist passing by who alerted police. The young British sisters are the only known witnesses to the crime. Police in Britain would not mention al-Hilli by name but did confirm that a 54-year-old man had been arrested. Authorities in Britain rarely identify suspects who haven't been charged. Maillaud said the two young witnesses had been questioned as recently as last week but had little to offer the investigation. He said Zaid al-Hilli was called in for questioning June 21 in France, but failed to show up.</content>

		<title>Fish and chip battle ends up in courtroom</title>
		<description>A brother kicked and punched his sister because she did not share a feed of fish and chips with him, the New Plymouth District Court has heard.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8836117/Fish-and-chip-battle-ends-up-in-courtroom</link>
		<category>national/crime</category>
		<content>A brother kicked and punched his sister because she did not share a feed of fish and chips with him, the New Plymouth District Court has heard. Luke James Martin, 24, denies two counts of assaulting a female after the incident on June 19 last year when he was staying at his sister, Teraumahoro Taputoro's Stratford home. She now wants nothing to do with him. The jury was told 10 extended family members, were living in the four-bedroom house at the time. There was little food apart from the previous night's soup in the house. Crown prosecutor Nina Elliott Taputoro, her partner, another brother and their babies were all in her bedroom where the children were having fish and chips for tea. Taputoro had given Martin, his girlfriend and another woman money to go to buy bread to make toast to go with the soup. But when Luke returned to find the rest of the family in his sister's room with fish and chips he became angered. He went barging into the bedroom ranting that they were not sharing with him, Elliott said. When his sister tried to settle him down, he had kicked her in the stomach sending her flying into a corner on her back. He then grabbed a pot with the previous night's dinner in it and bashed a hole in the wall. When she told him to leave the house he punched her in the chest. Police were called. For Martin, defence counsel Kelly Marriner said there was no love lost between the sister and brother at the time and she wanted him out of the house. Giving evidence, Taputoro said Martin had been staying with her for about a month and his girlfriend about a week. They were all getting on well until Martin's wallet went missing. "Everyone was blaming everyone else and it was not the same as before," she said. When an angry Martin came into the bedroom with clenched teeth, "I could see he was pissed off," she said. When he asked why they were not sharing she said she told him they bought fish and chips for the babies because they did not like soup. To Marriner she admitted she had thrown a small bottle at the bedroom door but it came nowhere near Martin. She denied she grabbed him near his throat, saying she tried to placate him by putting her hands on his shoulders and attempting to talk to him. But she did not have time. He pulled his knee into his stomach and booted her. "I went flying back from the force of the kick," she said. He also punched her in the chest. "I don't speak to him at all because of what he done to me and he can't admit it. I can't trust him again," she said. The trial is expected to finish today.</content>

		<title>I never left, says fired-up Tua of comeback</title>
		<description>There's something about the look in David Tua's eyes.</description>
		<link>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/8836063/I-never-left-says-fired-up-Tua-of-comeback</link>
		<category>sport/other-sports</category>
		<content>There's something about the look in David Tua's eyes. Or maybe it's the way his voice rises when he talks boxing and the way it softens when he speaks of his struggles outside the ring. It's an honesty, a peace of mind. A fire still burns within the 40-year-old boxer and, until it fades, he has no plans to hang up the gloves. In an exclusive interview with the Tua talks about his return to boxing, his dream of another world title shot and the breakdown of his marriage. Ask Tua why he's making a comeback and he'll tell you he never left. He simply had to take care of personal business after his loss to American Monte Barrett in August 2011, which all but derailed his career. "They were things that weren't going to go away unless I sorted them out," he said at his Onehunga gym yesterday. "But I never left. I love the game, it's been my life. There was never a time that I considered retiring." Tua will fight 2.02-metre tall, Russian-born Alexander Ustinov, 36, at Hamilton's Claudelands Arena on August 31. It's a credible matchup. Ustinov is ranked 10th by the World Boxing Association and has a record of 27 wins, one loss, compared with Tua's 52 wins, 4 losses and two draws. Critics are already saying Tua's too old he's in it for the money he should give up before he embarrasses himself. "I know in myself that this is the right thing to do and this has always been the right thing to do," Tua said. "There's got to be a better and an easier way to make a living than getting hit and getting paid. It's never been about the pay cheque." It is believed his last two fights were hindered by problems in his personal life - the split with wife, Robina, and financial difficulties. "It was about me and my wife and where things were at that stage of my life. Personally, apart from my mum, she's the greatest person I know. It was just unfortunate that those things unfolded maybe the way they shouldn't. "For me, I looked at my career and what I was doing at the time and made a real tough decision on where I'm going." If Tua wins impressively against Ustinov, it will put him on a career path towards another world title shot. "I still dream about that," he said. "I'm a realist as well and I've got to take one fight at a time." Tua is well on the road to getting in top shape with trainer Lee Parore and is intensely focused on the fight ahead. But, perhaps most telling of all, for the first time in a long time, he's happy. "A happy David Tua's a dangerous David Tua," he said. "I can only hope that on the 31st of August that the real David Tua stands up."</content>

		<content>Nightmares still haunt the young man sexually violated by a Hawke's Bay entertainer who lured the 17-year-old to his house for a modelling shoot seven years ago. The teenager went reluctantly because he was promised he would be paid, the Napier District Court was told last month. The man's 10-year-old daughter had been watching TV in a nearby room when he performed a sex act on the teen. During his trial the man said he never intended the photo shoot to culminate in a sexual encounter. He believed the teen was consenting because he did not stop him. Last month, a jury found the man guilty of sexual violation. Judge Raoul Neave yesterday sentenced him to three years and one month's imprisonment. He extended name suppression until December because he believed publication could harm the man's family. The complainant, now 23, said he was pleased justice had been done but felt guilty for sending someone's father to prison. The incident preyed on his mind for years, despite his efforts to bury it. After years suffering in silence, he confided in an aunt, which led to the man being charged. He still does not like having his photo taken, finds it hard to trust people and even harder to forgive them. "I'm still finding my feet. I haven't got my stuff together."</content>

		<content>A violent attempt to settle a cash debt - in which a man was fatally attacked outside his home - was allegedly orchestrated by a prison inmate with access to a cellphone. The Crown yesterday opened its case in the High Court at Hamilton against four men accused of killing Tauranga businessman Gary Kimura in 2011. Taonui Hiku, 27, Witeri Neketai, 35, and Joseph Rewiri, 45, are jointly charged with Kimura's murder. A fourth man, Jesse Hartley, 28, is charged with manslaughter. Crown prosecutor Greg Hollister-Jones told jurors a series of text messages between the four accused provided background to the attack on Kimura at his Margaret Rd house on October 5, 2011. The Crown alleges that in October 2011, Rewiri, who was a serving prisoner at the time, gained access to a cellphone and contacted Neketai, requesting he collect a debt of more than $30,000 from Kimura. Early on October 5, Neketai replied via text to Rewiri confirming he would visit Kimura at home. Neketai wrote: "Going to send the shits up him. Make his a...hole start to twitch when he sees us roll up." Rewiri replied saying he "would so love to be there" and urged Neketai to "hammer him first". Neketai was allegedly driven to Kimura's house by Hartley in a red Mazda stationwagon. On the way they picked up Hiku. Hollister-Jones said Hiku was the "fresh-faced" lure whose role was to extract Kimura from the house as well as act as physical reinforcement for Neketai. In evidence, Kimura's daughter, Melani Kimura, told jurors she was at home with her dad, mother and younger brother when she heard a knock at their front door. She answered the door and was greeted by a smiling young man and a red car parked in the driveway with two men seated inside. Kimura said the young man was friendly and asked for her dad. She went upstairs and told her father: "There's a kid here, I don't know who he is, waiting for you." Gary Kimura went downstairs and a few moments later his daughter heard a loud "ping" sound resembling a coin hitting steel. Her mother looked outside the dining room window and saw her husband lying in a pool of blood and the red car gone. Hollister-Jones alleged Kimura went to the front door and was met by Hiku and Neketai. The Crown alleges Neketai punched Kimura in the face, throwing the 109-kilogram man backward, and causing him to strike his head on the concrete. Neketai then allegedly kicked Kimura in the face, causing blood to splatter on a nearby planter. Kimura's wife, Rosina Kimura, went to her husband's aid. He initially tried to stand but stumbled, striking his head again, she told the court, in tears. "There was blood coming out everywhere and all around his head was a big pool of blood." Hollister-Jones said the punch, kicks and subsequent "low fall" caused massive head injuries to Kimura, including bleeding on the brain. He was taken to Tauranga Hospital before being transferred to Waikato Hospital and undergoing surgery. He remained in a coma and was transferred back to Tauranga Hospital where he died on November 16, 2011, after complications from a feeding tube inserted into his stomach.</content>

		<content>Gasping for breath under the weight of a jet boat, Ollie Williams didn't think he'd see his girlfriend again. "I thought I was going to die, the boat was getting heavier and heavier. It was just as if there was no hope," the Hastings man said. He was part of a group of jet boaters doing a run along the Ngaruroro River on Sunday afternoon to celebrate the shortest day of the year. The jet boat was racing back when the river narrowed into sharper bends. The boat hit the riverbank and flipped on its end. The driver was flung into the water, while Williams, 21, and his girlfriend's father were pinned to the riverbed by the weight of the boat. They were stuck for just over a minute and a half, but it felt like forever, he said. Other boats on the run soon pulled up to help, and half-a-dozen men managed to lift the boat off the pair. That first gasp of air was a huge sense of relief, Williams said. The pair were carried on to the bank and kept warm until the Lowe Corporation rescue helicopter came to their aid. Williams and the other man were flown to Hawke's Bay Hospital. The older man was discharged with minor injuries. Williams is black and blue after suffering a bruised pelvis, back, tailbone and abdominals. He knows how fortunate he is not to have been killed. But he does not blame the driver. All the drivers on the run that day were experienced, he said. "It's just one of those things - it's like all sports, things can go wrong."</content>

		<title>Capital commuter chaos</title>

		<content>Prepare your favourite sing-a-long albums for the car - commuters can expect to be sitting in traffic for a lot longer this week. With Hutt Valley and Wairarapa trains cancelled because of storm damage to the tracks, and bus replacements clogging State Highway 2 between Wellington and Petone, peak-hour commuters faced long delays at both ends of the day yesterday. The New Zealand Transport Agency is warning that the congestion could last all week, and spokesman Anthony Frith said having "a bit of a sleep in" could be the best solution. "We would advise people to make the trip to work earlier or later if they can. Anything to avoid the peak-hour delays. "If you are going to travel in peak hour, you are going to get caught." On the roads, one Wairarapa commuter's normal hour-long morning trip to Wellington took nearly three hours yesterday. He started out at 5.45am but hit heavy traffic in Lower Hutt, with the stretch from Melling to Wellington taking an hour and 20 minutes. "It would have been quicker to get out and walk," he said. Another said her normal 30-minute bus trip from the Hutt Valley into Wellington City took 90 minutes yesterday morning. About 7500 people commute into Wellington by train from the Hutt Valley every day, with another 1500 from the Wairarapa. A crowd at Petone railway station were ferried to Wellington by 25 buses, which managed to clear the backlog by 9.45am. In the evening rush, the Wellington Motorway was jammed for about 2 hours from 4.30pm, but was flowing freely again by about 7.15pm, NZTA said. Central operations manager Mark Owen said car-pooling and working from home could both help ease the congestion. "Wellington is still recovering from its biggest storm in decades, so it's not surprising that there's some disruption as KiwiRail works hard to get train services fully restored." KiwiRail chief executive Jim Quinn said the damage to the line alongside the harbour between Wellington and Petone was unprecedented and, despite repair crews working 12-hour shifts around the clock, the track was unlikely to be restored until at least the end of the week.</content>
